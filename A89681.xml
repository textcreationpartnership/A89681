            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thank you for the favour you did me in imparting thoſe papers to me, compoſed by our learned friend in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Eccleſiaſtical Government, under which the Church of God hath liv'd ever ſince it was eſtabliſh'd by the Preachings Apoſtolical. I ſee and love his zeale, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour his learning, but am moſt pleaſed with his method and order of argument; for having proſperouſly defended and illuſtrated the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his
<pb facs="tcp:115308:3"/>
material and grave diſcourſes upon the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> he does to very good purpoſes proceed to defend her <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> that as it already appears that her <hi>Doctrine</hi> is <hi>Catholike,</hi> ſo it may be demonſtrated that the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is no other than that of the <hi>Catholike Apoſtolike Church;</hi> ſhe by the ſame way being truly <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and a <hi>Society</hi> of Chriſtians, by which all Chriſtendome were put into <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſociety,</hi> that is, became collective and united bodies, or Churches. And indeed they are both of them very weighty and material conſiderations; For more things are neceſsary to the being of a Church than to the being Chriſtian. Firſt, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preached Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, and every day winning ſouls to Chriſt did adopt them into his Body, and joyned them to that Head; and there they had life and nouriſhment. But until their multitudes were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they were no Body Politick; they were ſo many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons; till the Apoſtles according to their places of abode, gathered them under one Paſtor, and they grew into Communion, and were faſtned to one another by the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Aſſemblies.</hi> This Government with the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely of ſome unconcerning circumſtances hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Church of God; and the Church of <hi>England</hi> was baptized by it at the ſame time it was baptized into the faith of Chriſt; onely of late ſome endeavours have been to rifle this Government, and to diſsolve her being a body Politick, and almoſt reduc'd her onely to the being Chriſtian; which becauſe it ſeemed alſo to be in ſome danger, <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> having ſo near relation to each other, I ſuppoſe it very adviſedly done of him firſt to do what he thought fit for the ſecuring the Doctrine, and then by the method A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical proceeding to the immuring of that Doctrine by the walls and towers of Government, and I finde he hath
<pb facs="tcp:115308:3"/>
done it well. His arguments are grave and cloſe; not florid, but preſſing; his obſervations choice, his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
and little by-diſcourſes pleaſant and full of inſtructions, his refutation ſharp and true; his returnes pertinent; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing trifling but his adverſarie; who, becauſe he ſpeaks but weak things, miniſters not occaſions worthy enough for this learned man to do his beſt. But he hath made ſupply (I perceive) and by taking little occaſions by the hand, he hath advanced them to opportunities of handſome diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; and to my ſence, hath to better, more full, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purpoſes than any man before him, confuted the new faſhion of Congregational and gathered Churches; which muſt now needs appear to be nothing but a drawing Schiſme into Countenance and Method, and giving a warranty to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities; it is a direct crumbling of the Church into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuits and little principles of being, juſt as if the world were diſſolved into <hi>Democritus</hi> his dreame of Atomes, and <hi>minima naturalia.</hi> Every man loves Government well-enough, but few of the meaner ſort love their Governours; eſpecially if they think themſelves wiſe enough to governe; for then they are too wiſe to be governed. Now this Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant or Congregational way ſeemes to me the fineſt <hi>compendium</hi> of humouring and pleaſing all thoſe little fellowes that love not, that endure not to be ſubject to their betters; for by this meanes a little Kingdome and a royal Prieſthood is provided for every one of them; a Kingdom of <hi>Yvetot;</hi> and ſome had rather be chief but in a garden of Cucumers, and govern but ten or twenty abſolutely (ſo they do) than be the fifth or the twentieth man in a <hi>Claſſis,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable under the Apoſtolical and long-experienced go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by thoſe Superiours which Chriſt by himſelf, and by his Spirit, and by his bleſſing, and by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and by the favour of Princes hath made firme as
<pb facs="tcp:115308:4"/>
heaven and earth, never to be diſsolved, until the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Fabrick of the houſe of God it ſelf be ſhaken.</p>
            <p>I pray give my ſervice to the good Man; and I do heartily thank him for my ſhare of the book, by which I have already had ſome pleaſure and ſome profit, and hope for more, when my little affairs will give me leave ſtrictly to peruſe every unobſerved page in it. When I onely heard of it, I was confident he would do it very well; and now I ſee it is ſo very well done, and in that grave judicious manner, if you had not told me, I ſhould have been confident it had been his, <hi>Vox hominem ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</hi> I pray God that he may finde encouragement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the mertt of his labours; and acceptance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good intentions, and that his book may not receive its eſtimate according to the cheap and vaſt numbers of others, but according to its own weight. The ſtrength that was put to this would have reſiſted a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger adverſary, but it could not readily have ſupported a worthyer cauſe; and becauſe I beleeve it was done with as much charity as learning, I hope it will have the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God, and of the Church, and the peace of all good men. I onely have this to adde further: I wiſh that this worthy man would enter into no more warre but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the open enemies of mankinde; that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute for nothing but for the known Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, that he would contend for no intereſts but the known concernments of the Spirit in the matter of good life, which is the life of Religion; and my reaſon is, not onely becauſe I finde that he calls his adverſary <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and it is not ſo good that <hi>Brethren ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;</hi> but becauſe men are wearied with diſputes, and the errors of this or any age, after the firſt batteries and onſets by the Church, are commonly beſt confuted by the
<pb facs="tcp:115308:4"/>
plaine teaching of poſitive truths and the good lives and the wiſe governments of our Superiours; and after all, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that though he does manage this conteſt prudently and modeſtly, yet the ſpiritual warre againſt direct im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety he would manage much more dexterouſly and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly; and for his auxiliaries he would be more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the direct and proper aides of the Spirit of God. This is very well, and he will I doubt not ſtill do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when a more concerning argument is managed by ſo excellent a hand. Sir, be pleaſed when the Book is printed (in caſe you think it fit, and that it be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by authority) to ſend me a Copie of it into the farre diſtant place of my retirement; that I may be recreated with the worthieſt productions of my friend; for it will be inſtruction and refreſhment too, to</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prince of peace knows who bequeathed peace as his laſt Legacy to all his followers, that I am not a man of contentions, or have loved to ſtrive, this being the firſt time that ever I ſet pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a conteſtation with any man. And to this kinde of any other I have been moſt averſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have found by experience in falling upon, and paſſing through the controverſies Theological, the ardour of devotion hath been abated, and many hours that might have been better ſpent in piety, and the ſtudy of neceſſary fundamental doctrines, ſurreptitiouſly ſtollen from me. When therefore I had ſet up my reſolution to meddle no more with the Polemicks, I was awaked by an importunate Letter, in which finding many foul aſperſions to be caſt on my Mother, or rather the Catholick Church, (I mean not the Romane, for I never did, nor do acknowledge her to be worthy of that name) in whoſe ſteps the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> hath troden in her Doctrine and Diſcipline legally conſtituted, I thought my ſelf bound according to my Talent to vindicate her in her conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall ſay this needed not, it having been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſo vigorouſly done by abler pens; yea, and confirmed to be wiſely conſtituted, by the diſtractions and diviſions which have fallen upon it, ſince thoſe foundations have been ſhaken and removed by aery brains, then which there cannot be a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger plea for the neceſſity of that Diſcipline which is here oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:115308:6"/>
and vilifyed: I muſt confeſſe this is true, and that by all wiſe and ſober men, our Mother hath gained hence thus much advantage, that
<q>Plus colitur, placet, atque viget, laudatur, amatur.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, and her greateſt Adverſaries, were they unbiaſſed, might come to know <hi>quae recta ſunt,</hi> although Athenian like for ſome reaſons, they are all for news, and therefore <hi>facere nolle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet being provoked I held my ſelf bound to anſwer, yea, though I did but ſay over again thoſe things which Wiſe, Learned, Pious men had ſaid before me; for I intended not to impoſe upon my Reader, which is uſual, by obtruding that for my own, which indeed I have but borrowed from other men. Eaſie it had been for me to vary phraſes, and in other words ſo to have dreſſed up the judicious determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Learned before me, (who have in this diſcourſe ſaid ſo much that little can be added) that men might have attributed ſomething to me. But neither the ſubject upon which I was to write would ſuffer it, nor yet mine own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. For ſuppoſe I ſhould magiſterially deliver the ſelf ſame truth as from my ſelf with thoſe Worthies; yet when were I able to do it with the ſame vigour and eloquence? how could an equal credit be given to my words, as to their grey hairs, and impartial relations of Church-practice, who were eye-witneſſes of what they have delivered? Beſides, it more ſharply ſtrikes the mind, and more deeply ſeizes upon the underſtanding, and wins belief ſooner, what the Pillars of the Church have left to us in their Monuments, then what I or <hi>Cluvienus</hi> ſhall ſet down. And this is the reaſon, that where I found any thing oppoſite, either in Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines, I have expreſſed it in their own words, and not in ſuch as I could eaſily have diſguiſed. And in this I have followed the judgment and authority of the graveſt men, who have taught me, that <hi>in eo laborare quae ſemel rectiſſimè dicta ſunt, nova orationis forma enunties, intempeſtivae

               <note place="margin">Moller, praefat. in Pſalm.</note> Therefore whatſoever the Reader ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in this Apology ſpoken to the point in hand, I deſire he would not attribute it to me, but to thoſe who have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured before me upon that ſubject, whoſe Diſciple I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly profeſſe my ſelf to be, and a Pigmy upon their ſhoulders. Only if the Reader ſhall find their allegations more aptly and vigorouſly applyed and preſſed home, or more perſpicuouſly opened and cloſely laid together, or ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects here ſupplied, and looſer diſcourſes fortified, I have my aime.</p>
            <p>This Apology had not appeared in publick, had not the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Admonitory Epiſtle call'd it forth. For my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in it was firſt to ſatisfie my friend that ſent it, an old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, though alwayes of a diſſenting judgment, which yet I hoped had been better bottomed: and then to put into the mouths of my brethren of the Clergy (to whom I underſtood the Copy was ſent as well as to my ſelf) what to reply. But when I found it abroad, I conceived my ſelf bound to let the World know what might be returned to the imputations; for I conceive to the conſiderate Reader they will appear no more, after he hath peruſed the Reply.</p>
            <p>So fairly I have dealt with the Admonitor, that I have not here and there catched at pieces, or taking any advantages by wreſting any expreſſions in the letter; But deduced the whole into parts, and the parts into ſeveral paragraphs, and reſolved every paragraph into diſtinct propoſitions, framed in the very words of the Letter, which the writer cannot deny to be his own aſſertions, and annexed a ſeveral anſwer to them, that ſo the Authour of the Admonitory ſhould not complain that any wrong is done him, or his ſenſe miſtaken, as is uſual among Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants in this kind: And I hope withall I have ſo demonſtrated the Truth, where the matter was capable of a demonſtration, that there wil be left no more juſt cauſe to wrangle. And my hope is in part confirmed by this, that the firſt part of it being ſent to the Authour of the Admonitory more than ſixteen months ſince, it received no return; which gives me juſt occaſion to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it is not ſubject to any notable exception. The other two parts have lien by me ever ſince that was ſent; and that they were
<pb facs="tcp:115308:7"/>
not made companions with the firſt, ſome reaſons there are, which I hold it not neceſſary to make known.</p>
            <p>From any bitterneſſe of language (though ſometimes juſtly provoked to it) I dare ſay the frowardſt adverſary will acquit me. Sarcaſms you ſhall meet with none, Aſtîſmi now and then; and that cannot be imputed; for it was the honour of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the graveſt and wiſeſt of the Philoſophers, that he was <gap reason="foreign">

Reader, it was the Authours purpoſe ſometime to delight thee, but moſt of all to edifie, informe, confirme thee, which if it may be effected, he hath his end. For it is my hearty prayer that a period may be ſet to this wrangle, and that we may all turn to the way of truth and peace.</p>

            <head>A KEY to open the <hi>Debate</hi> about a <hi>Combinational Church,</hi> and the power of the KEYES. <hi>The firſt Part.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE chief point of the Controverſie lies in this, to know in whoſe hands the power of the Keys ſhall be, or rather who ſhall be the Prime ſubject of the Keys.</p>
            <p>Of this I finde three opinions.<note place="margin">Cotton, Burton, Goodwin, Nye, <hi>Aſſert the name.</hi> Bayly, p. <hi>132.</hi>
               </note> The firſt defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Independents or Combinationals. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond defended by the Presbyterians; and a third by the Prelates.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Combinational Churches are divided in this point; for ſome ſeat power in the whole Congregation ſo ſoone as aſſociated in Covenant, even before they have any Officers. Others after the Officers are choſen ſettle it in them alone. A third even then <hi>conjunctim,</hi> make the whole body the ſubject of the Keys. Which of theſe, or whether any of theſe is like to be true, will appear if we conſider theſe two or three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Presbyters and Ruling-Elders cannot be the prime ſubject, is apparent, becauſe that the Keys were ſeated in ſome, before they were in them, if you be conſtant to your own principles; For how came they to be Elders and Rulers? were they not created by the power of the Keys? and who created them? was it not they who did elect and ordaine? The prime power then muſt be in the electors and ordai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, not in the elected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, whence it will follow inevitably, that the Ruling Elders are not the prime ſubject of power; for a power there is which precedes theirs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After Election and Ordination, they, <hi>viz.</hi> Ruling Elders cannot be ſo neither, becauſe it is your common Tenet, that the Congregation may again upon diſpleaſure reſume the Key, Depoſe, Excommunicate, caſt out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115308:8"/>
their own Elders, which they could not do, were they not the prime ſubject of the Keys, and authority primarily in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if you ſhall ſay, that <hi>conjunctim,</hi> people and Elders together are the prime ſubject, this cannot be neither. Becauſe before they are thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, the Electors and Ordainers had the true eſſence of a Church (as you teach) both for matter and forme, though they had no Officer nor Elder, and then muſt radically and originally be inveſted with this power in the firſt combination, without any reflexion on this conjunction. So that as they are an organical Church heightned by Rulers and Elders, it makes them not the prime ſubject of the Keys, for this you ſay they had before.</p>
            <p>That the people <hi>diviſim</hi> without the Elders and Rulers are not the prime ſubject of this authority, I prove in this Tract demonſtratively. I onely here adde, that the power of the Keys conſiſts in binding, looſing, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adminiſtring Sacraments, &amp;c. which till you can prove to be in the people originally, I ſhall never yeeld the power to be originally in their hands.</p>
            <p>The difficulties are ſo many, and the ſubtleties ſo nice among you in this diſpute, that they have forced your fineſt heads, <hi>Robinſon, Cotton, Goodwin, Norton,</hi> to invent ſo many diſtinctions, diviſions, ſubdiviſions, that a man muſt needs think himſelf in a maze that reads them; the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
of the Schoolmen, which you ſo much complaine of, are exceeded by you. And yet when all's done, by theſe you could never yet ſatisfie your own party, and therefore expect not to ſettle others. It ſhewes you are in a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth, and would faine help your ſelves out by the ſmall threads of theſe prettily invented diſtinctions. In a word, that there are very many knots and objections, to which your Tenet is liable. For you know that all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions were invented to give light to that which is very perplexed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, dubious, ambiguous, and ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uivocal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this your aſſertion is mainly denied, oppoſed, battered and beat down by the Presbyterians, I need not tell you, or that they deny the the Congregation to be either <hi>conjunctim,</hi> or <hi>diviſim,</hi> the prime ſubject of the Keys, and ſettle it upon the Elderſhip <hi>primò, immediate, adaequatè Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitèr &amp; objectivè;</hi> they will grant you that the whole Church is the ſubject; but <hi>autoritativè &amp; formalitèr,</hi> they place it in the Guids, or Presbyters without a Biſhop.

For to make his thoughts good, he hath ſo many nicities, ſo many new-coined diſtinctions of power, of the Church, of I know not what, that he is able to confound any Reader, and indeed drives on the point till he becomes almoſt unintelligible. Is not this think you a rare device in him and in yours to finde out a Truth, and ſettle a conſcience about Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

For thus much I may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that I am of a peaceable and docible diſpoſition. Peaceable, and

                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.12.</note> it cooles devotion, and animates faction. I verily beleeve he is the leſſe Chriſtian, that knows beſt to wrangle. There is no end of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many books, eſpecially of Controverſie. For of theſe there is no end ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ceſſation or profit. None for ceſſation, becauſe the parties intereſſed either through ſelf-love or pertinacy, rarely are by the moſt forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn to retract what they have once maintained. None for profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the contenders are ſeldome bettered or made more religious, would I might not ſay far worſe, more fierce and of alienated affections. This needs no proof, ſince it is too apparent in the encounters of all ſides, whether for Papiſtry, Prelacy, Presbytery, Independency, &amp;c. The Writers pens are for the moſt part ſteep'd in gall, of which tart juice I promiſe you, you ſhall not taſte one drop, it being ſo contrary to my nature, whom the Dove that deſcended on our Saviour hath embued with mildneſſe and a ſtudy of peace. And as I am inclinable to peace, ſo I am very docible alſo. Wax is not eaſier to receive an impreſſion, than I am the ſeale of truth, but then it muſt be made evident unto me either by plaine and expreſſe Scripture, or elſe by ſome demonſtration and deduction evidently drawn from thence, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I muſt remaine where I was. This becauſe I finde not in your diſcourſe, my judgement is not upon it altered. The words I finde in it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the arguments and proofs in it very few. 'Tis a pretty Narrative, not any demonſtration; pardon me therefore if I yeild not.</p>
                  <p>The gifts and graces you take notice of in me, I freely and openly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge are farre ſhort of your conceit; they cannot ſwell me but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, being laid together with my imperfections; and were it not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in you, you might behold them farre more eminent in many of my companions and acquaintance.

                  <p>OF what you write in this paragraph in general, I am not now to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to wit, what hath been the external government of Chriſts Church from the beginning to this day. And how farre I agree with you, will by and by come to be examined. But in the meane time let me put you in minde that theſe words [<hi>God hath thought meet to conſtitute three ſeveral ſorts of viſible Churches</hi>] are improper. For the Church of God, before, under, after the Law, was but one in eſſence and being; ſo we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve One Holy Catholick Church, the bonds of whoſe unity are extant, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.4, 5, 6, 7. Let then the external government be what it will, yet this cannot conſtitute three ſeveral ſorts of viſible Churches, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſpecies muſt proceed from internal principles, not from extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal accoutrements. This then is not properly expreſſed. But if you mean, as I hope you do, That the viſible Church of God hath had a different kind of regiment and exiſtence, one from the beginning under the Patriarchs to <hi>Moſes,</hi> another from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, and a third from Chriſt to the end of the world, I aſſent to you.

                  <p>IN the ſubſtance I agree with you; But I pray take it not ill, that I cleare up ſome expreſſions that may be miſtaken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You ſay the firſt viſible Church is Domeſtical, and did ſo continue from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> That at firſt the diſcipline and government of the Church began and continued in certaine families, cannot be doubted, but that it ſo continued till <hi>Moſes</hi> dayes, is not eaſie to conceive, becauſe as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies multiplied, there muſt be a multiplication of theſe Chu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ches, as there was of houſes, whence it will follow that every eldeſt ſonne muſt be King and Prieſt in his own houſe; and then what will become of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the firſt-borne,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.29.</note> who during life was to be Lord over his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</p>
                  <p>Better therefore I conceive it is to ſay, that this reglement was Paternal, and that all the ſeveral families were to depend on him <hi>durante vitâ,</hi> both for inſtruction and diſcipline. For while the firſt father liv'd, he was, 1. a Prophet to teach. 2. A Prieſt <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſacrifice, intercede, to bleſſe and give thanks. 3. A Prince to rule and puniſh. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon father guided the Church for nine hundred and thirty years. <hi>Seth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> was his fathers aſſiſtant for five hundred years, and taught his children who were then the Church to call on the name of the Lord,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> and continued that charge one hundred and twelve years after his fathers death. <hi>Enoſh</hi> did the like to <hi>Seth,</hi> and all the heirs of the promiſe to the fathers. God alwayes ſtirring up the ſpirits of ſome excellent men to preach in his Church, while their fathers yet liv'd and guided the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; as for example, <hi>Enoch</hi> that propheſied three hundred years,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.22. 2 Pet. 2.5. Gen. 5.27.</note> firſt under <hi>Adam,</hi> and after under <hi>Seth,</hi> in whoſe dayes he was tranſlated. So <hi>Noah</hi> a preacher of righteouſneſſe began under <hi>Enoch,</hi> and held on for ſix deſcents, till the year the flood came, the very year his grandfather <hi>Methuſalem</hi> died. I would call theſe then extraordinary and immediate Prophets, raiſed up by God to inſtruct his Church during the time of their fathers principality and prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Noah</hi> after his grandfather <hi>Methuſalems</hi> death govern'd the Church for three hundred and fifty years, and left the reglement to <hi>Sem,</hi> who ſucceeding his father in the Covenant, and adopted into the dignity of the firſt-borne, govern'd the Church one hundred fifty and two years after his father, even till <hi>Abraham</hi> was dead, <hi>Iſaac</hi> dimme, and <hi>Jacob</hi> fifty two years old, and therefore might be the <hi>Melchizedech,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 14. Heb. 7.</note> the Prieſt of the moſt high God. The next that ſucceeded <hi>Sem</hi> was <hi>Jacob</hi> by Gods eſpecial choiſe too, <hi>Eſau</hi> having ſold his birth-right. As for <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> they could not lay claime to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e rights of primogeniture, <hi>Sem</hi> being yet alive. Call'd indeed <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and promiſed to inherit it, but poſſeſſed of he was not, becauſe <hi>Sem</hi> out-lived him, he therefore
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115308:11"/>
is called a King, and the Prieſt of the moſt high God. In <hi>Jacob</hi> this primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture was eſtated, among whoſe ſonnes God divided the honours and dignities of <hi>Sem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron. 5.1.</note> appointing the Scepter and ſeed to <hi>Judah,</hi> the Prieſthood to <hi>Levi,</hi> the double portion to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which never were again conjoyned in any but in Chriſt Jeſus the onely Prieſt that ever ſucceeded according to the order of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By whom the Church was after <hi>Jacobs</hi> and <hi>Joſephs</hi> deceaſe governed in <hi>Egypt,</hi> is not ſo certaine, but very probable it is, that it was done by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and heads of the twelve tribes, over which I conceive <hi>Judah</hi> was the chief,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.8.</note> according to the tenor of <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing, Thy fathers children ſhall bow down before thee. The ſumme of this is, that when the people of God increaſed and multiplyed into a Nation, and diverſe Nations for ought we know, as before the flood they did, and when after the flood they did the like, it is not ſo proper to call it a Domeſtical Church that was ſo farre extended. And if the inſtruction thereof was Domeſtical becauſe every father was to teach his houſhold and off-ſpring: yet the government thereof was Paternal; He that was ſet over the reſt being to be a father to the reſt, and to performe all Natural, Civil, and Eccleſiaſtical offices to them, and they again to do all duties to him by which they are bound by the fifth Command, <hi>Honour thy father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your next words are, that this Domeſtical Church was guided and governed by the firſt-borne of the family]. But this muſt be underſtood with a graine of ſalt; for this though for the moſt part, yet is not alwayes true; for what will you ſay to <hi>Abel</hi> who was younger then <hi>Cain?</hi> to <hi>Sem</hi> younger brother to <hi>Japheth?</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> intimates in his notes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.32. and proves, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 21. which is therefore thus dubiouſly rendered by our Tranſlatours. Unto <hi>Shem</hi> alſo the father of all the children of <hi>Eber,</hi> the brother of <hi>Japheth</hi> the elder, even to him were children borne. What will you ſay to <hi>Jacob?</hi> to <hi>Ruben</hi> when his primogeniture was loſt? Neceſſary then it is, that you limit your words, that they carry this ſenſe. God did conſecrate the firſt-borne of the family, as holy to himſelf, to be Prieſt in his Church, and increaſed their dignity with this princely prerogative, that they ſhould be Lords over their brethren, and honoured by their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers children, as ſucceeding their fathers in the government and prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; unleſſe they were rejected from that honour by Gods ſecret counſels or manifeſt judgements, and others named by God himſelf to ſuſtaine that charge. Thus the clauſe is clear, and true.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againe you ſay that theſe were types and ſhadowes of Chriſt Jeſus in the ſeveral houſes of profeſſing Saints]. What then is every profeſſing Saint a King, a Prieſt, a Prophet in his own houſe? This I dare not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, and I hope you will not; there were no more words to be made of a Presbyterial Church if this were true: for every man might officiate at home, and need not ſubject himſelf to any Presbytery; he might baptize, adminiſter the Sacrament, &amp;c. being authoriz'd by this Type. I ſhould rather then ſay that theſe were types and ſhadowes of Chriſt Jeſus who is the King, Prieſt, and Prophet in his Church, and yet executes all theſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115308:11"/>
offices for her good and ſalvation, then make them types of profeſſors in their ſeveral houſes, who nor may nor can <hi>ex officio</hi> undertake theſe functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It follows,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As doth plainly appear to all that do deliberately weigh what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and what is neceſſarily implyed in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.7.</p>
                  <p>Theſe texts I have deliberately weighed, and finde not in them, neither expreſſed, nor yet neceſſarily implyed what you produce them for; In <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.4. I reade, that <hi>Abel</hi> brought the firſtlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof, <hi>and the Lord had reſpect to Abel and to his offering;</hi> but can any man either expreſſely or by neceſſary implication ever prove from hence, that the firſt viſible Church was a domeſtical Church, or that it was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the firſt-borne of the family? that they were types and ſhadows of Chriſt Jeſus in the ſeveral houſes of profeſſing Saints? Or that this Church did continue from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abels</hi> dayes to the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> pilgrimage in the wilderneſſe? That <hi>Abel</hi> ſacrificed to God, that the offering he brought was of the beſt, that God reſpects, loves, and is reconciled to the perſon before he accepts his gift and ſervice, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be collected from hence. But I cannot diſcerne which way to deduce from this text any of the former propoſitions. This text you compare with <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.7. When I thus reade, <hi>and they ſhall take of the blood, and ſtrike it on the two ſide poſts, and on the upper door poſt of the houſes wherein they ſhall eate it:</hi> An injunction I finde here concerning the uſe of the blood of the Paſchal Lamb, but not a ſyllable that can be drawne to your purpoſe. But the beſt is that what you ſay for the ſubſtance, is ſo clear in the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that no man need queſtion it. Let the miſtake be but notified, and we agree, and therefore I proceed.</p>

               <p>THe Chuch of the ſecond ſort was a National Church, conſiſting meerly of Jewiſh perſons, and their Proſelytes for its members, who were inſtrumentally enlightned and led by the Prieſts and Levites, as their ordinary Miniſters; the which kinde of Church-government laſted among them from the life of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the death of the Meſſias, and no longer, as it is exceeding plaine and cleare to any one that can finde in his heart adviſedly to compare the ſeveral teſtimonies of the Old and New Teſtament together, which will contribute pregnant light to this particular point; ſuch as are <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.6. <hi>Num.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 9, 10. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.14.17. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12.</p>

                  <head>The Replication.</head>
                  <p>THe ſubſtance of this Paragraph is agreed on alſo. To wit, that the Jews with the Proſelytes were a National Church, taught and led ordinarily
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115308:12"/>
by the Prieſts and Levites; extraordinarily by the Prophets; and when they ceaſed, and the <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> God ſpoke ſometimes to us ſo by the <hi>Bath Col,</hi> or <hi>ſilia vocis.</hi> And that kinde of government began with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ended at the death of the Meſſias, or a little after, as I hinted before, and rather encline to think. For I am ſure actually till then it did not, howſoever it ought to have done, Chriſts death upon the Croſſe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to all the rites and ſacrifices of the Ceremonial Law.</p>
                  <p>Many things I could here obſerve about their Proſelytes, their Prieſts and Levites, their whole government, which yet I paſſe by, as not ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the preſent queſtion. One thing onely give me leave to tell you, that ſome of theſe texts are not ſo concluſive to your purpoſe, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. For firſt out of that of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that the Jews were a holy Nation and people, will eaſily be deduced, and as much may be ſaid of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is as evident, if you compare the place with the firſt of <hi>Peter</hi> 2.9. for to this place of <hi>Exodus</hi> I make no doubt the Apoſtle alludes, when he affirmes of the Chriſtian Church, that it is a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar prieſthood, &amp;c. I would gladly know why I may not out of theſe words as well conclude a National Church of Chriſtians, as you do out of the other a National Church of Jews and Proſelytes. And then your National Church will not be proper to the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh State, but communicable to the State of Chriſtianity alſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. you conclude rightly that the Prieſthood being chang'd, there muſt be a change of the Law, that the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was quite aboliſhed, no more ſacrifices to be offered, legal purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to be obſerv'd; no nor dayes, moneths, times, years in a Jewiſh ſenſe to be kept up, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9, 10. In a Jewiſh ſenſe I ſay; for this is plaine <hi>Galaticari.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul.</note> But to prove from hence, as you uſually here do, that no feaſts may be obſerv'd by Chriſtians, was never meant by the Apoſtle. Compare the text with <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16, 17. and you ſhall finde that theſe were ſhadows of good things to come; ſhadows, and then they muſt point out a body, and that was Chriſt;<note place="margin">Amrſ. Medul. lib. 2. c. 15. p. 16.</note> under Chriſt then the ſubſtance of theſe rites muſt be looked for; and here give me leave to put you in minde of a rule of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Feſti dies anniverſarii, novilunia, &amp; ſumiles inſtitutiones, quae merè ceremoniales fuerunt, aequitatem iſtam generalem in ſe etiam continent, &amp; adhuc uos docent certos quoſdam &amp; accommodatos dies cultui publico aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari debere.</hi> But of this more afterward.</p>
                  <p>That place you produce from <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. ſpeaks home to your purpoſe, and I ſhall endeavour to give a further light to it. Thus the Apoſtle begins, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>And you being dead in teſpaſſes and ſinnes, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſſes, blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to his Croſſe.</hi> In which words three things are to be obſerved. 1. The miſery of man. 2. Who freed him from it. 3. The manner of his freedome. His miſery was that he was in treſpaſſes and ſins, and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the fleſh. He who freed, was God in and by Chriſt, quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115308:12"/>
pardoning; it was a work of power and mercie; for to raiſe to life and quicken is an act of power; to pardon and forgive, of mercie, which was <hi>gratuita, &amp; univerſalis;</hi> free, for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, all treſpaſſes. 3. And then follows the manner, Blotting out the hand-writing. A bond or hand-writing is that act which paſſeth betwixt a Creditor and his Debtor; that put caſe the Debtor ſhould be ſo impudent as to plead <hi>non factum,</hi> the creditor might have his owne ſeale, act and deed to produce againſt him. This God had againſt man; it was contrary to him; but now through Chriſt it was blotted out, it had no power to condemne, it was taken out of the way, it had no force to keep God and man aſunder, it was nailed to the Croſſe, torne in pieces, thruſt through with nailes, faſtened openly there, and as it were proclaimed publikely that it was cancelled. And in this all Interpreters agree. But what this Chirograph or hand-writing was, they agree not. For ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine it to that bond which Chriſt made with <hi>Adam, Of every tree of the garden thou mayeſt freely eate,</hi>

                  <p>THat the Church you meane, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church of Chriſt is to be laſt, is eaſily granted; but whether to be the longeſt or no, is more than you or I, or any man elſe can tell. But to let this paſſe. <hi>Hic opus eſt Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po;</hi> for I conceive not well the ſenſe of your propoſition, becauſe you phraſe it Presbyterial, or Combinational, ſince theſe two by the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties are made <hi>Diſparata,</hi> and then muſt really differ. I know not therefore what to make of this; Or whether it be here a Diviſive or an Explanative particle. If you make it Diviſive, then it ſeemes not to agree with your following words; for you know that thoſe of the Presbyterial Church, though they will allow your profeſſing members liberty to elect, yet they ſtoutly, and with open mouth decry their power to Ordaine: and you allow the Church you ſpeak of to do both. If you make <hi>Or</hi> Expoſitive, then it can but onely declare the ſenſe of the former word Presbyterial, and will be farre from your intent, which is, if I miſtake not, that all the profeſſing members of a Church be combined in a Church Covenant, which you know the Presbyterial Church will never admit. For although Presbyters can be content to be in their own ſenſe Covenanters, yet they abominate to be in a Church-Combination; and again, though the Church combiners will joyne in a Church Covenant, yet they will not yield to be Presbyterial Covenanters.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Diſparata</hi> then are not hanſomely coupled in this place, neither can I gueſſe at any other intent you have in it, except it be to Umpire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two parties, by finding out a Church that ſhould be both Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and Combinational, which hitherto the heat of zeale would never ſuffer the learnedeſt of both ſides to do. For the Presbyterians condemne your Combination by a Church Covenant as a Chimera, a fancy, a novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a meere humane invention, contrary to Chriſts Ordinance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all Church power: And the Combiners on the other ſide, judge as harſhly of the Presbyterian Elderſhips in the whole reformed Churches, as of the Prelacy: nay and worſe too, if <hi>Baſtwicks</hi> words be true, which he hath in the Poſtſcript of his ſecond part, <hi>page</hi> 6. <hi>viz.</hi> The Presbyterial government not ſuiting with the humour of the Independents, they abhorre it, and all ſuch as endeavour to eſtabliſh it, and wiſh rather that the old trumpery were brought in again, and profeſſe they had rather have the government of Prelates. That which follows I forbear, that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend not. Thus <hi>Baſtwick;</hi> which if true, 'tis not poſſible that a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115308:14"/>
and a Combinational Church ſhould be all one as you ſeeme to make it. And therefore you muſt forgo one of the termes, and make it onely Presbyterial, or onely Combinational, if you will ſpeak intelligibly in this queſtion. But I ſhall make the beſt ſenſe I can of your words, and in order ſpeak to them both. And firſt of the Presbyterial Church which you call alſo Combinational, upon what ground I know not; for I meet with neither of theſe Epithets fixed to the Church of Chriſt in the Scriptures, nor in any antiquity. The firſt of theſe is new, and and the ſecond naught; for I never read of a Combination in a good ſenſe. Why can we not ſpeak as good Chriſtians have done before us, and call it the Chriſtian, Catholick, and Apoſtolical Church, but muſt pleaſe our fancies with theſe new termes of Presbyterial, or Combinational?</p>

                  <p>Good Sir, conſider how harſh it ſounds to ſtile Chriſts Church the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Church, and the number of the Profeſſors that are united by faith to Chriſt, to be combined in I know not what. But now I ſhall take into conſideration theſe termes ſeverally, and firſt I will begin with the laſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Combinational Church. The firſt Author whom I meet with, it is <hi>Ameſius,</hi> and he defines it to be <hi>Parochialis, vel unius congregationis, cujus membra inter ſe Combinantur;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 39. <hi>Sect</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</note> there's your word, <hi>&amp; ordinarie conveniant in uno loco ad publicum religionis exercitium.</hi> This your Synod at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New England,</hi> choſe rather to call Congregational; for the word Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent they like not, (though I ſee no cauſe of diſlike, if the particular Congregations muſt not depend one of another, but remaine in full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as <hi>Ames</hi> delivers in the ſame chapter, Sect. 20. &amp; 26, 27.) And thus you there define this Congregational Church to be a company of Saints by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, united into one body by a holy Covenant for the publick worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p>But I pray you tell me what needs this combination by a ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? would not the firſt in Baptiſme have ſerved, if heeded and kept, to have done all this? and it ſeemed it did, by the very text your Synod pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to prove it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. For the Penitents and beleevers pricked to the heart by <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon, gladly received the word, and were baptized, and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread, and in prayer, &amp;c. where we read of their Baptiſme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Church-fellowſhip, and in the duty of that fellowſhip; but that this is done by a combination, a confederation or holy Covenant, a Vow,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115308:14"/>
other than that made in their Baptiſme, we read not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And indeed it needs not; for what is it that Profeſſors can binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto by Covenant, when they are admitted into the Congregation, that they have not in their Baptiſme bound themſelves to before? Whether you ſhall conſider the Myſtery, the Form, or the end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Baptiſme for the Myſtery there is an Indument, and a ſtripping,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.14. Gal. 3.27.</note> which the ancient Church reduced to two words, <hi>Credo, Abrenuncio:</hi> In the firſt there is the putting on of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>For as many as are baptized have put on Chriſt.</hi> Firſt, as Lord, acknowledging no other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe voice to hear, whoſe doctrine to rely upon, but onely his. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as Jeſus, aſſuring themſelves, that there is no other Name given under heaven whereby they may be ſaved. Thirdly, As Chriſt, as well their anointed King ſubmitting themſelves to his will: giving their names in to fight under his banner, and ſwearing themſelves his ſubjects: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their anointed Prieſt, reſting in his one ſacrifice as the onely ſufficient; in his ſole interceſſion, as the onely powerful. Secondly, In the <hi>Abrenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi> or ſtripping part, they renounce and forſake the Devil,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.20.</note> and all his works, the pompes and vanities of the wicked world, the ſinful luſts of the fleſh, among which are all Hereſies and Schiſmes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the forme it is by our Saviour appointed in the name of the three perſons of the indiviſible Trinity, and ſo it is performed; neither of <hi>Cephas</hi> the ſirnamed Rock, nor of <hi>Paul</hi> a great Apoſtle.<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19. 1 Cor. 1.13.</note> The reaſon wherof you may read in my expoſition of the Church Catechiſme, <hi>page</hi> 172, 173.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the end, they which are baptized are thereby made the ſonnes of God by Adoption and Grace, inveſted with an inheritance everlaſting:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.26. Rev. 1.5. Mal. 1.11. Rom. 12.1. Col. 3.5.</note> made Prieſts to God, to offer and ſlay: To offer that <hi>mund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m oblationem,</hi> pure offering, or living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice, <hi>viz.</hi> the cleane and unbloody ſacrifice of prayers and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving: and then to ſlay themſelves, mortifying their affections and luſts.</p>
                  <p>Yea but men may be minded of all this by a new Covenant, and upon a ſecond engagement made more watchful to keep their firſt vow. Be it ſo, for this alſo the Church had provided, without this ſeparating combination, when ſhe ordained, that all baptized children when they could ſay their Catechiſm, ſhould be brought to the Biſhop to be Confirmed, which order; were it in uſe, and reſtored to its original purity, the wrangle about the formality of a Church, Covenant, and collecting of members might be quieted and compoſed; There being in Confirmation the ſubſtance of what is ſo much and ſo hotly contended for, and that farre better grounded and bottomed than any new device can be, as I ſhew you in my Catechiſme, <hi>page</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Elogy you give to your Combinational Church, that it is their opinion and practice quietly and cordially to ſubject their earthy, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and unruly wit, to the heavenly, infallible, and uncontrolable will of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That ſo it ſhould be I confeſſe and deſire; but how it is we ſee and feele
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115308:15"/>
ever ſince the Combination. But what now is this but an opinion, and onely commendable? I thought it had been neceſſary, <hi>&amp; de fide;</hi> that it muſt be ſo, and could not be otherwiſe. For <hi>Opino</hi> is <hi>eutis vel non e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> You ſhall have it in <hi>Ameſius</hi> words. <hi>Aſſenſus ille qui praebetur ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritati contingenti propter rationem pracipuè probabilem ab intellectu appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſam,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Medulla. <hi>1.</hi> Theſ. de fidei divina unitate.</note> 
                     <hi>opinio vocatur.</hi> The truth muſt be contingent and probable onely, of which a man retaines an opinion; it may be, it may not be; if no other reaſon can be produced for it, but a Topical. But that all men muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject their earthy will to the heavenly Will of Chriſt is ſo certain, that it cannot be denyed by any good Chriſtian: Hereafter let it paſſe then for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and let it be a principle of faith, which is more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But you go on and ſay; This hath been the commendable practice of your Combinational Church. But here you muſt give me leave to think; for if I would ſay what I know, I ſhould fetch blood and perhaps pay for it too. Your Combination was for the worſhip of God, and that <hi>cultus naturalis inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutus,</hi> Ameſius ſo divides it; the principles of the firſt are faith, hope, charity; the acts, hearing of the Word and Prayer, under which is an Oath: Of the laſt, Gods preſcribed Will or his Word. This is the Rule; but whats become of the practice? I will not meddle with your faith, which yet you know in many of your Combinational Churches is not ſound, nor in the Socinians, nor Antimonians, nor in the Browniſts, Familiſts, nor the Anabaptiſts, nor the Quakers, nor the Singers. Theſe youle ſay are not of you, but are gone out from you; yet you cannot deny, that theſe are Combinational Churches. The practice then of all the Combinational Churches is not commendable in Gods worſhip in this reſpect. Your hope may be great, but I fear it may be preſumption, when the foundation of faith upon which it ſhould be built is ſo uncertain and tottering. As for the charity of your party in general, I finde it dying rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſervant a man may find divers of you of three of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt Table, but of the third, your practice ſhews you make little accompt; and as for the ſecond Table, he who ſhall lay to heart your actions, muſt needs conceive that you eſteeme it but for a cypher. I will no farther rake into this wound. I wiſh you had not given me occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> on to do it, when you affirmed that it was the commendable practice of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binational Church to ſubject their earthy, erring and unruly will quietly and cordially to the heavenly, infallible, and uncontrolable will of Chriſt, to which I finde their practice ſo contrary. I pray preſſe me not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for I am reſolved not to give the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> you. but if you are deſirous to be ſatisfied of the opinions and practice of the Combinational Church I aime at, be pleaſed to reade a book written by <hi>Robert Baily</hi> a Scot, entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>A Diſſwaſive from the Errours of the times,</hi> Printed in <hi>London,</hi> 1645. and publiſhed by Authority.

                     <hi>2</hi> A Presbyterial Church.</p>
                  <p>THis is your other Epithet, and I ſuppoſe you mean by it a Church to be governed by Presbyters. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is equivocal, and therefore till it be diſtinguiſhed, nothing can be concluded from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Presbyter in the Old Teſtament properly belongs to the Elders of the people, either in a common notion, or as members of the Sanhedrim: not any body or perſons peculiarly Eccleſiaſtique, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.16. Nay,<note place="margin">

                  <p>But againſt this I affirme, that there never was any ſuch Presbyterial Church before <hi>Calvin,</hi> and to that purpoſe I here propoſe, and hope to make good theſe Propoſitions againſt any opponent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there muſt be government in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt inſtituted this government, and Governours for it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this government muſt be perpetual.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the Apoſtles were thoſe Governours for the time; and for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, their Succeſſors appointed by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That their Succeſſors were Biſhops in Name and Office.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That for the execution of this Office Chriſt gave to the Apoſtles the Keys, and they to their Succeſſors onely.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That this power conſiſted in Ordination and Juriſdiction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they onely could ordaine, and juridically proceed.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That at firſt the Apoſtles, and after the Biſhops, did both without a Presbytery.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Yet that by the Apoſtles a Presbytery was inſtituted in ſome Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, who were Eccleſiaſtiques onely.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That yet none of theſe Presbyters were Biſhops, but aſſiſtants onely, being diſtinct from them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. That this Presbytery without the Biſhop, could not uſe the Keys.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The higheſt function which was Epiſcopal, the Apoſtles reſerved to themſelves for ſome time, and that for three reaſons. At firſt there were but few convicted,<note place="margin">Acts 14.27. 1 Cor. 16.</note> whence their labour was imployed in turning the firſt Key, in opening the dore of faith, that great and effectual dore; and all the helps they could make either by Prophets, Evangeliſts, Coadjutors, Paſtors, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Planters, Waterers, to this purpoſe was little enough.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that this Decree was generally aſſented to; for <hi>Decretum eſt toto orbe,</hi> it muſt be then Apoſtolical and Oecumenical. Fifthly, now conſider the words of the Decree, <hi>ut unus de Presbyteris electus ſuperponeretur caeteris.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 2. &amp; 3.</note> 1. It is <hi>Unus,</hi> it is One, not many, that the care of the Church might eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially belong to one.

He muſt be <hi>Electus,</hi> of whom <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith not, (of that more anon) but I dare ſay conſidering the time of which <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaks, it was not without the conſent of the Apoſtles, if not by them. 3.

In this power then the Identity lies not. 2. He muſt then meane in Juriſdiction, and that this is his meaning, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, by thoſe words <hi>Communi Presbyterorum conſilio Eccleſiae gubernabantur,</hi> which your ſide catch at too, as making for the preſent Ruling Presbytery, as indeed at the firſt ſight they may, but throughly lookt into, nothing at all. I will ſhew you where the miſtake lies. Firſt, in the word Presbytery; for yours apply it to the whole Presbytery, Lay and Clergy, whereas <hi>Hierom</hi> as is manifeſt, ſpeaks onely of the Eccleſiaſtique; for it is of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that was before or when thoſe Schiſmes reigned. Secondly, he ſaith <hi>gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernabantur in imperfecto;</hi> and when was that? in the Apoſtles dayes; for then in a Church that had a Presbytery without a Biſhop, put caſe at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> or had a Presbytery with a Biſhop over them, as at <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Epheſus,</hi> it is moſt true <hi>Communi Presbyterorum conſilio guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabantur,</hi> the Presbyters were admitted <hi>in partem ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>llicitudinis.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied that the Apoſtles ordaining theſe Presbyters, had power in themſelves, and might have governed <hi>durante vita,</hi> alone retaining the power; when then they gave any power to others, it was deligated; for I hope they loſt none of their power in giving Orders. Whence it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the Presbyters when admitted in ſome acts of Juriſdiction with the Apoſtles, cannot challenge a right of governing affixed to their Order, <hi>qua Presbyteri,</hi> becauſe they did aſſiſt in ſubordination and dependencie. That the Apoſtles aſſumed theſe Presbyters in acts deliberative and conſiliary to aſſiſt firſt at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 15. was a meer voluntary act, from which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample that it was derived to other Churches, will not be denied; and hence the laſt clauſe of <hi>Jeromes</hi> words will be moſt clear, <hi>Noverint epiſcopi ſe magis conſuetudine Eccleſiae, quam Dominicae diſpoſitionis veritate Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris eſſe majores, &amp; in communi debere Eccleſiam regere.</hi> For by the Commiſſion <hi>Sicut miſit me Pater,</hi> given to the Apoſtles, and in them to their ſucceſſors onely, they could not challenge it. It may well, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the voluntary act of the Apoſtles, be called an Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Ordinance; but in ſtrict termes <hi>Dominica</hi> it was not, nor <hi>Dominicae diſpoſitionis veritas,</hi> according to <hi>Jerome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if this ſenſe of <hi>Jeromes</hi> words like you not, I ſhall yet offer you another; At firſt, as I ſaid, the Presbyters by delegation from the Apoſtles with common advice and equal care guided the Church under the Apoſtles; but after Biſhops were appointed, the whole care by little and little was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to one, and ſo at laſt by cuſtome Presbyters were utterly excluded from all advice and counſel, and Biſhops onely intermedled with the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church.

to be <hi>Jeromes</hi> meaning in that place, his following words ſhew, <hi>Imitantes Moyſen, qui cum haberet in poteſtate ſolus praeſſe populo Iſrael,</hi> 70. <hi>elegit cum quibus populum judicaret.</hi> The Biſhops then ought to do as <hi>Moſes</hi> did.

No, but when they might rule alone, to joyne with them others in the fellowſhip of their power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did. <hi>Moſes</hi> did not abrogate his ſuperiority above others, but took ſeventy Elders into part of his charge. So <hi>Jerome</hi> would have them. And thus much the King was content to grant, and reſtore, as you may read in his book <hi>cap.</hi> 17. about the middle. I ſaith he, am not againſt the managing of this precedencie and authority in one man by the joynt councel and conſent of many Presbyters; I have offered to reſtore it, &amp;c.

                  <p>HEre again your words are dark. For if by <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Elders, you meane thoſe in Orders, I ſhall readily admit them to the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, whether Teaching or Ruling. But if you intend under theſe words to introduce into the Miniſtry either to teach or rule men, that are not of the Clergy (ſo you know we ſpeak, and ſo I muſt ſpeak for diſtinction ſake, for elſe I cannot be underſtood in this queſtion) I abſolutely deny it.</p>
                  <p>For there was never any Lay-man <hi>ex Officio,</hi> admitted to teach ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Scripture; called and ſent he muſt be before he did undertake to preach. So the Apoſtle intimates,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.15.</note>

For as a man muſt have inward endowments, gifts, and ſufficiencie, ſo he muſt have an outward calling before I ſhall call him a Teacher in the Church of God. And I hear you are not againſt me in this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But about a Ruling Elder, I fear you and I ſhall differ; for in your Presbyterial Churches, you admit into that number thoſe who are not of the Clergy. Many of your Presbyters being meer Lay men. Of the Texts you hope to prove it, I ſhall conſider anon. And here about theſe Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders I ſhall deliver my mind. 1. Negatively. 2. Poſitively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatively. That Ruling Elders in the Church were never Laicks. Presbyters we read of, and Presbyteries in the Apoſtolical writings, but none Lay. This negative will be proved as all other negatives are; that is, by the contrary affirmative.

                  <p n="2">2. Poſitively. The Keys Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, and they to their Succeſſours; and with them ſo much power as was ordinarily of permanence

and perpetuity in the Church, which power conſiſted in four particulars; the Diſpenſation of the Word, the Adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is clear in the promiſe, <hi>Tibi dabo claves,</hi> and in the performance, <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut miſit me pater, ſic mitto vos; quorum peccata remiſeritis,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <p>THe Debate about Elections of Church-Miniſters, cannot be better determin'd than by the Scriptures; let us look then, how it was <hi>ab initio.</hi> I finde three ſorts of Election mention'd in the New Teſtament; By the Spirit, by lots, by voices.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By the Spirit ſpeaking in his own perſon, were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> called from <hi>Antioch</hi> to preach to the Gentiles. By the Spirit ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Prophets,<note place="margin">Acts 13.2. 1 Tim. 4.14.</note> was <hi>Timothy</hi> deſign'd; <hi>Neglect not the grace which was given thee by propheſie, with impoſition of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115308:19"/>
And again,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.18.</note> 
                        <hi>This commandment I commit to thee according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, that went before of thee,</hi> that is, by direction of the Holy Ghoſt, and not by voices, as <hi>Oecuminius, Theodoret, Chryſoſtome, Throphylact,</hi> expounds the place. For this kind of Election was uſual in the Apoſtles times, the Spirit of God directing them on whom they ſhould lay their hands. By that Spirit were <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> directed on whom they ſhould lay their hands at <hi>Samaria.</hi> And ſo was <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Epheſes,</hi> when he laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Church; ſo that he might truly ſay, Take heed to the flock,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> whereof the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers. For it was the Holy Ghoſts doing to notifie unto <hi>Paul</hi> the perſons that ſhould receive impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands, and to poure out his wonderful bleſſings on them, to make them meet Paſtours and Prophets, whereto he had choſen them.</p>
                     <p>Yea, this dured ſome time after <hi>Pauls</hi> death, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reports,<note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>i. d.</hi> Supplying the Clergy with ſuch men as were ſignified or marked out for that purpoſe by the Spirit. Or if you read it as <hi>Hanmer</hi> tranſlates it chooſing by lot, then this was done to avoid ambition and contention: however it was of thoſe who were <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and ſo the mix'd multitude choſe not whom they pleaſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. For ſecondly, by lot, I graunt it might be done, and then Saint <hi>John</hi> followed the pattern in the Election of <hi>Matthias</hi> to the Apoſtolate;<note place="margin">Act. 1.</note> which is the ſole example, that can be given in Scripture in this kind. And in this the people could have no voice, if you will weigh the circumſtances of the Text. For firſt the company that were then preſent were onely one hundred and twenty, of which eleven were Apoſtles, ſeventy two diſciples,<note place="margin">Ver. 15.14.</note> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers women, with <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Jeſus; now if you deduct eighty three, and the women out of one hundred and twenty, what a ſmall remnant will there be of the people left to vote. Secondly, it is recorded indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they appointed two not determinately expreſſing who they were,<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> and ſo it might be the Apoſtles alone, or the Apoſtles and diſciples together for ought any man can ſay to the contrary. Thirdly, make what can be made of it, yet here is no more than preſentation which falls very ſhort of Election; for it is written they preſented the two. Fourthly, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Election to God, Shew whether of the two thou haſt choſen:<note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> and ſo it was reaſon; for the place to which one of them was to be advanced,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.1, 17, 18, &amp;c.</note> was an Apoſtles place; and an Apoſtle might not be choſen by men, but by God alone.</p>
                     <p>And here to remove a miſtake, I ſhall intreat you to obſerve this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that the name of an Apoſtle hath a double acception. 1. In a ſtrict ſenſe, for an eye-witneſſe of our Saviours actions, life, death, and one immediately choſen and ſent by God, and ſo there were no more but twelve. Whence ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi>

Muſt one be ordained to be a Witneſſe: 2. Or elſe the name of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is more largely extended, for an inſtructed Witneſſe, and ſent by the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.25.</note> who yet had that honorary name; ſo <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> is called the Apoſtle of the Philippians; <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> are ſo term'd; <hi>Titus</hi> and others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. and <hi>James</hi> the brother of our Lord is call'd an Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.19. He was not <hi>Jacobus Alphei,</hi> nor <hi>Jacobus Zebedei,</hi> and therefore none of the twelve; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. this <hi>James</hi> is named as diſtinct from the twelve; for there it is written, that Chriſt appeared to the twelve, then to five hundred brethren at once; after to <hi>James.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe no man ever did, ever could chooſe an Apoſtle; for they had an immediate vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and immediate miſſion. In the laſt ſenſe there is not a ſyllable in the Scripture of their Election by the people. Perhaps, for ſo it is recorded by <hi>Dorotheus,</hi> that they were of the ſeventy; but when they were advanc'd and authoriz'd to be Apoſtles, that is, Biſhops in the latter ſenſe, the Apoſtles only elected them, and impoſed hands on them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hitherto we hear not a word of any Election by the Profeſſing Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the work of the Miniſtry; let us then come to the third way, which was by voices; and let us conſider whether we can finde it that way. It is moſt true, that the Election of the ſeven Deacons was referr'd to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and to this purpoſe your text is rightly cited, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5.

And then I pray, what can this place make for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Presbyters, and Ruling Elders by the people? Are theſe no more but Deacons, Officers of Tables and Widows? That the people ſhould Elect theſe there was great reaſon; for they were to be Stewards and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of their Charity; and therefore to ſtay the murmure that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe of partiality in them, and ſuſpicion of any unjuſt dealing, they advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the multitude to chooſe their own Almoners. The Churches treaſure was laid at the Apoſtles feet to be diſtributed as every one had need; they left it,<note place="margin">Acts. 2.

But they accepted of their preſentation, and with prayer laid their hands on them for the Office; which was at the higheſt a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of money, and no cure of ſouls.

of Presbyters or Ruling Elders?</p>
                     <p>Yea, but you'll ſay, the other text you cite, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23.<note place="margin">Acts 14.23.</note> will ſtrike it dead; but upon a ſerious view nothing leſſe. For thus we reade there <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> ſignifies not to Elect, but to Ordain; of which more by and by. The Ordainers were Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Presbyters; here is not ſo much as a ſyllable of the people, no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any act of theirs. This then is ſo plain a perverting of the text, that I hope no wiſe man will ever more object it. The truth is, the Apoſtles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed hands to make Paſtours and Prophets in the Churches as they travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, popular Elections they made none. For your other texts, I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der apart, becauſe they are not directly to this purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus I hope I have made it appear, that there is not any firm ground, I had almoſt ſaid any colour for Election of Presbyters or Ruling Elders by the Profeſſing Members of the Church in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but did not then the People chooſe their Paſtour in the primitive ages of the Church? To gratifie you, I confeſſe they did: but this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles dayes, and then Scripture muſt not be urged for it. It was not a priviledge, that belongs to them of right, but out of convenience; and was deriv'd from the rules of Chriſtian equity and ſociety. Hence it came to paſſe, that the people when their deſires were accompliſhed did quietly receive, willingly maintain, diligently hear, and heartily love their Paſtours. And could the people have tempered their grief, when their deſires were croſſ'd, their intereſt in Electing their Paſtour had been better regarded, and longer continued: But experience of their Schiſmes, Factions, Tumults, Uproars, Murders, if they might not have their wills, cauſed both Ancient fathers and Councils to miſlike that the people ſhould bear the ſway in theſe Elections, and forced Chriſtian Princes, if not wholly to exclude them, yet greatly to abridge them. I could if I pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed give you in a long liſt of examples of both kinds, both of whom, when, where, and how long the cuſtome of their Election continued; and by whom, and upon what occaſions abridg'd: But I ſpare you. This in a word; when they did Elect, it was not by any Scripture-right, and at moſt it was no more than a preſentation; and it lay in the power of thoſe in Authority to refuſe the preſented, which was ſometimes done. And the emergent miſchiefs took it away; which it never could have done, had it been a command of God. Now that it is poſſible, that ſuch miſchiefs may ariſe, and frequently do ariſe from popular Elections, I appeal to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, who have been an eye-Witneſſe of it in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

the ſeveral Angels of the ſeven Churches, (who by all the Ancients are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſingle perſons, that had power over all other in thoſe Churches) but will in the full latitude through the univerſal Church in thoſe times be made clear by the next and beſt evidences we have, <hi>viz.</hi> From the conſent of the Greek and Latine fathers, who generally reſolve, that Biſhops were thoſe Succeſſours.

                     <p>And one part of their Offices in the Church was to Ordain. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt firſt in <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 20. There were many Presbyters before <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed their Biſhop, yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſent him of purpoſe to impoſe hands;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> and ſay it was with the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; yet it can never be proved that any of that Colledge was no more than a Profeſſing Member. You know how ſtrongly all the Presbyterians pleade for the contrary; and was this injunction onely perſonal, and to end with <hi>Timothies</hi> life?<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.13, 14</note> Not ſo neither. For this charge he layes upon him in fearful words; <hi>I charge thee in the fight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Jeſus Chriſt, who before Pontius Pilate witneſſed a good confeſſion, that thou keep this Commandment without ſpot, unrebukable, till the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis agreed by all, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epiſtle eſpecially ſets an order for the Government of the Church,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22.</note> among which, that a Biſhop <hi>lay not hands haſtily upon any man is one.</hi> This then was not Temporary, but to laſt till the end of the world.</p>

Secondly, that if any one of an inferiour rank preſumed to ordaine, his act was reverſed by the Church as unlawful, and the ordained admitted no otherwiſe to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion than as a Lay-man.

                  <p>Secondly, that this place cannot be underſtood of the functions of the Church, will be evident theſe two wayes. 1. Teachers are here expreſſed, but Paſtors are omitted, and therefore might Governours (the word you catch at) be mentioned in ſtead of Paſtors. If this ſatisfie not, then tell me, what functions can you call theſe that follow in the Church of Chriſt? are Miracles, that is, power to work miracles, gifts of healing, a faculty to ſpeak divers tongues, functions and offices? Ornaments I ſhall grant you they were of the Paſtoral calling, and ſo was ability to govern. To rule wiſely is a great gift of the holy Ghoſt, and more needful than the other. To the government of the Church belongs more than cenſuring of manners, and examining witneſſes; wiſdome to prevent dangers, to direct doubtful caſes, to diſcerne ſpirits, to calme ſtrifes, is requiſite, which rarely are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in your Lay-Elders. Beſides, pray conſider, that if in this place you ſhould make your Governours diſtinct from the Apoſtles, the Apoſtles themſelves could not <hi>qua Apoſtoli,</hi> be Governours, which I hope you will not ſay. Had not the Apoſtles, Prophets, Teachers, power in the Church to do miracles, to heale, to ſpeak with tongues? If theſe three be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers offices, but graces, and all three found in every Apoſtle, in ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Teachers, then why ſhould not government alſo that is reckoned in the middeſt of them be a gift alſo of the holy Ghoſt, beſtowed on ſuch Prophets, Paſtors and Teachers, whom the Spirit of grace and truth would vouchſafe to honour?</p>

                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115308:24"/>This is my firſt reaſon, and my ſecond will be clearer by reflecting upon the gifts of the Spirit, of which we have a liſt in this chapter, and comparing them with the functions.

For ſo it may happen that the offices may exceed the number of the officers, and ſo every one muſt have more than two of them,<note place="margin">

For put caſe that <hi>Robinſons</hi> words be true, that a company conſiſting, though but of two or three gathered by a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made to walk in the wayes of God known unto them, is a Church, and ſo hath the whole power of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Anſwer to the 32. Queſt. p. 43</note> even the ſame right with two or three thouſand. Generally you know it is received among you, that ſeven will make a full and perfect Congregation, and that the aſſociation of theſe few thus ſeparate by a Covenant, is the eſſential forme of the Church. Which if true, then is it not poſſible to find ſo many diſtinct functions in the Church, becauſe in ſo ſmall a number, there cannot be found men for them. Let it be then granted, that the Apoſtle in this chapter ſpeaks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of gifts, not of functions, and the ſenſe will be clear. Apoſtles there were then in the Church, and they had all theſe gifts in a greater meaſure than any other. Prophets there were and Teachers, and to theſe the Spirit divided the gifts as he pleaſed, in what meaſure, and to what perſons he beſt liked; to one to work miracles, to another to heale, to help and comfort, to guide and governe, to ſpeak tongues, to interpret tongues as might beſt ſerve to gather the Saints, to plant the Church.</p>
                  <p>I muſt profeſſe unto you, that I have both now and heretofore looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this text with as quick an eye as my weakneſſe would give leave, and could never yet finde it in any thing that made for your Ruling Elders. No, you perhaps will ſay, do you not finde here <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, governments? Yes, I do, but will it thence follow that it muſt upon neceſſity be the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lay-Ruling-Elders you dreame of? Why might not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, the Prophets, the Teachers here mentioned by the Apoſtle be thoſe Governours here intended for ought you know? Of them the other gifts were verified, and why not then this alſo? They could work miracles,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115308:24"/>
they could heale, they could help and comfort, they could ſpeak all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and interpret tongues; what ſhould now hinder but they might by the ſame Spirit be endowed with the gift of government alſo? Which if it fall out to be true, as it indeed did, (yet the Apoſtles either by themſelves, or by thoſe they placed in the Churches which they planted, who were Biſhops, and onely Biſhops exerciſed the juriſdiction) you ſhall never be able to conclude out of this or any other place of Scripture, that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Churches were a diſtinct company from the Paſtours, which is I know, that you drive at.</p>
                  <p>But to gratifie you a little, I ſhall here willingly yield you more than I need. That in the Apoſtolical Church and after till <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time, there might be certain men choſen by common conſent of the Church to judge of all civil debates, that might ariſe betwixt man and man; you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would call theſe Governours, I ſhould rather call them Arbitratours, becauſe they had no coactive power to compel any Chriſtian to ſtand to their Arbitration farther than they would binde themſelves. And in caſe that any were refractory and obſtinate, the Paſtour might and did make uſe of the Church-Key, and debarre him from the participation of Chriſtian priviledges, ſo that he was by them eſteemed no better than a Heathen or Publican.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.1, &amp;c.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I will ſhew you the ground of my conjecture, 'tis out of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words; <hi>Dare any of you having an action againſt another,</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian he means, <hi>go to Law before the unjuſt, and not before the Saints? Paul</hi> did not debarre the Magiſtrates that were Infidels of their juriſdiction, nor create new Judges or Governours for civil offences in the Church; it was beyond his calling and commiſſion to do either of them; but when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chriſtians for private quarrels purſued each other before unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to the great ſhame and ſcandal of Chriſtian profeſſion, he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ver. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>they were better to ſuffer loſſe, to take wrong, to be defrauded.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 4.5.</note> But if this would not ſatisfie, if yet there were who would be contentious, then he wills them <hi>to chooſe if not the wiſeſt, yet the leſt eſteemed among them in the Church to arbitrate their cauſes,</hi> rather than to expoſe themſelves and their profeſſion to the mocks and taunts of Heathen and Profane Judges.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Arbitratours you may call Governours if you pleaſe; but properly they were not ſo, becauſe they were choſen either by conſent of the Liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants, or elſe appointed as I am induc'd to opine, by the choice of the Church for that purpoſe, but they could not interpoſe themſelves as Judges autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd by Chriſt; becauſe he himſelf as Mediatour claimed no ſuch power, would uſe none.<note place="margin">Luke 12.24.</note> You know his anſwer to the brother that moved him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance, <hi>Man who made me a Judge or Divider among you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now grant that all this be true, and that ſuch Governours began betime and continued long in the Church, even untill the Converſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours: Can you hence conclude, that they muſt upon neceſſity continue ſtill? no ſuch matter. For the Civil power and the Sword is in the Magiſtrates hand, and he is to take up all debates betwixt man and man; of theſe then there is no uſe. From theſe then to argue, that there muſt be Lay

Ruling Elders in the Church is a fallacy, ſince the cauſes they were to d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide were other, and their Authority by Church-right none at all.

               <p>All this while you have beſtowed your labour in the building and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Presbyterial or Combinational Church, and having ſet it up as you ſuppoſed, you have call'd me to view your goodly fabrique. I with heed looked upon it, ſearched into the foundation, and conſidered the walls and columns, and at laſt judg'd that it could not ſtand, becauſe the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was laid in the ſand, and the pillars and ſupporters over-weak; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials you have dugge out of your own fancy, not out of the true Rock; and cemented them together with mortar of your own making. Whether this be ſo or not, I leave it to them to judge, who ſhall ſadly weigh thoſe ſtones you have collected and brought out of the quarry of Gods book to ſet out this your work. You in the Acts finde an Election by the Church of Deacons; will it thence follow, that all future Elections for Presbyters muſt neceſſarily proceed by and from their votes and voices? or that ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is of the neceſſary conſtitution of a Church? the Apoſtles to avoid an imputation, that might be laid upon them in medling with many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that they might attend more ſeriouſly a greater buſineſſe, ſuffered it to be then ſo done; and is it a good conſequent, that therefore it muſt be alwayes done! <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Elders in every Church; can any man thence rationally conclude that the Presbyters, and Teaching and Ruling Elders muſt be of the Combinational Churches Regular Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? What, were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> of the people? or were they the Combinational Church? A twiſted cord will never draw and knit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and the concluſions together. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> gives a large Catalogue of the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and muſt there therefore be ſo many functions in the Church? He ſpeaks of governments, muſt they be of neceſſity in the hands of ſuch governours as you ſuppoſe? In the Revelation he mentions twenty foure Elders, and will you thence deduce that they muſt be neceſſarily ſuch Elders as you fancy in your brains? Had all or any of theſe texts inforced your concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction muſt not proceed from blind gueſſes and conjectures.

muſt give for what we have taught, and upon what ground we have taught it. It will not be enough for us to anſwer, we followed the judgment of this or that Church, but upon what certaine ground we followed it, becauſe we were to lead the multitude, and not to be led by them; to be lights to others, and therefore to have light in our ſelves. That Caveat of our Saviour would be lad to heart, <hi>Take heed that the light within thee be not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for then how grert is that darkneſſe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 11.35 Matth. 6.23.</note> This light within us is the light of conſcience, and the ground of that is ſcience, which alwayes flowes from certaine, prime, immediate, known principles, not from probable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural. If our ſcience then be not ſure and certaine, our conſcience can never be well fixed; if there be blindneſſe in the one, there will be darkneſſe in the other. We may miſtake that for conſcience, which is but humour; phanſie, a paſſion, animoſities may ſeduce us, and zeal hurry us too farre; yea, perhaps the zeal of God, for that zeal is a paſſion ſtill, and the more dangerous, when not guided by knowledge. What ſhould I ſay, that the actions which conſcience may perſwade us to, may be an infuſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſme of the black ſpirit, as it is, when many works of the fleſh come to us under the diſguiſe of Religion and Conſcience! It is with the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man, as it is with the eye of the body; be the object never ſo bright and viſible, if there be in the eye any thing that may impeach the ſight, either miſt, or duſt, or lime, the light within us will be but darkneſſe. Falſe doctrine of it ſelf, (ſet off ſometimes by the authority of the Teacher or by the power of ſome eminent followers and practiſers of it, or thickened by pride and obſtinacy, always by ſelf-love that always makes us think our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions the trueſt) is this ſame <hi>caligo tenebrarum,</hi> the miſt that dusks the eyes of the underſtanding:<note place="margin">Cant. 3.6.</note> Worldly profit and wealth are the pouders of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, the duſt that tickleth the eyes, and blinds the ſight of the wiſeſt. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie by emulation, or prejudice of affection, or wilfulneſſe by oppoſition, like lime torments the eye, and perverts the judgment concerning the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. To what purpoſe you will ſay is all this? you ſhall now ſee, it is that both you and I may retaine a good conſcience (for when I ſpeak to you, I ſpeak to my ſelf) And that I am ſure, nor you nor I ſhall be able to do, if either humour or phanſie, or paſſion, or black Enthuſiaſme over-ſway us, or the duſt of falſe doctrine, or the world, or envie, or hatred, or wilfulneſſe dim, tickle, or torment our eyes. The Father of lights remove all dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from us both, and guid us by the light of his Law.

                  <hi>yet the ſubſtance is in her.</hi> Her beauty is decay'd through bitter affliction, and her face furrowed with ſorrowes, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now left about her to make her lovely; yet ſhe is your Mother ſtill, ſhe waſhed you with water, ſhe gave you milk when a babe, ſhe fedde you with ſtronge meat when a man; ſhe honoured you with orders when grown; for a Mothers ſake I crave one good look, ſome pity; ſome regard! Why flie you from her? I cannot conceive you think her ſo diſhoneſt, as ſome Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts report; or that you will faſten upon her the name of a Whore; if you ſhould, I ſhould grow angry; and tell you, that in her Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhe came neareſt the Apoſtolique Church of any Church in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world; and this I openly profeſſe to make good againſt any Separatiſt whatſoever. Many ungracious ſonnes I confeſſe ſhe had, and they brought an aſperſion upon her, and the vials of Gods wrath have been juſtly, juſtly I proclaime poured upon her for their iniquities. The conſtitution was good and ſound, the execution paſſing through ſome corrupt hands too often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to reproof. Let not her then, who had declared her minde by rules and cautions againſt all abuſes, and taught what only ſhe would have done, be charg'd with her ſonnes irregularities. Set in Gods Name the Saddle upon the right horſe, and let not your Mother beare the whole blame.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But if yet any will ſay ſhe was blame-worthy; then either it muſt be in manners, doctrine or diſcipline.

Such were to be ſeparated by the Authority of the Church, and no man farther to ſeparate from the Church for theſe then by diſlike, by diſclaiming, by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115308:28"/>
diſallowing and diſcountenancing of their evil deeds: which was done by all good men in the Engliſh Church; I never learned yet, that corruption in good manners was a ſufficient cauſe of ſeparation from a Church. <hi>Calvin</hi> diſputes it ſtrongly; <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Inſtit. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will you hear <hi>Auſtin?</hi> There are ſaith he, bad fiſh in the net of the Lord,<note place="margin">Auſtin.

               <p n="2">2. To come to the ſecond head, Doctrine. In this you confeſſe that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not faulty, in that you approve her doctrine Catholique as expounded by me in the Catechiſme: your <hi>Salvo</hi> will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the third. Yet ſuppoſe that in her doctrine there had been ſome errour, yet this had not been ſufficient to give countenance to a ſeparation. For it is not every light errour in diſputable doctrine and points of curious ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be a juſt caſe of ſeparation in that admirable body of Chriſt, which is the Church, nor of one member from another. I ſhall go one pin higher.</p>
               <p>It is not an errour in a fundamental point, and yet that amounts to an hereſie by conviction, that can juſtifie a departure.<note place="margin">Perkins in Ep. Jude.</note> At <hi>Corinth</hi> there were that denyed an article of faith, the reſurrection. At <hi>Galatia,</hi> they fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were miſtaken in that great and fundamental doctrine of juſtification; and yet the Apoſtle dedicates his Epiſtles to them as to a Church, as to Saints, and perſwades not to ſeparation. Chriſt gave his natural body to be rent and torn upon the Croſſe, that his myſtical body might be One; and he is no way partaker of divine Charity, who is an enemy to this Unity. Now what errours in doctrine may give juſt cauſe of ſeparation in this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or the parts of it one from another, were it never ſo eaſie to determine (as I think it is moſt difficult) I would not venture to ſet it down in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, leſt in theſe times of diſcord I might bethought to open a door for Schiſme, which ſurely I will never do, except it be as a wiſe man ſaid, to let it out.</p>

               </head>
               <p>IN this ſecond part of your letter you propoſe a point I confeſſe of greateſt concernment, and ſuch which is moſt worthy of the ſad and ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; which is, how, where, and when the Church became ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, polluted and degenerate, as ſcarce the ſecleton, faſhion or face thereof is to be perceived, no not among the profeſſours of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
               <p>Good words I pray; The Reformed Churches you ſay cannot ſhew it, the Prelates cannot produce it, the Papiſts are at the ſame loſſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the profeſſours of godlineſſe, (be they who they will) the Sceleton is ſcarce to be perceived, hardly the faſhion, the face appears among them. And where then ſhall we looke for the ſubſtance, the body it ſelf, of which, if any man be not a part, 'tis but in vain to look for ſalvation? Since out of the Church no man can have hope of ſalvation, no more than that creature had of life, who was out of the Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi> God be merciful to us all poor Chriſtians, if our Mother that ſhould nouriſh us, be brought to bare bones, have but a face and faſhion of a Mother and nothing elſe; ſurely ſhe will never be able to give her children milk while they are babes, and ſtrong meat when they come to be men, if this be ſo.</p>
               <p>Now tell me I pray, what is the caſe, why ſhe is brought to this pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lamentable condition? how came ſhe ſo corrupt and polluted? Oh ſay you, that is quickly diſcern'd; ſhe is fallen from her Presbytery; for all the while ſhe was Presbyterial, ſhe was pure: Firſt, I could adviſe you to take heed of this affirmative, except you put Combinational unto it. For all the Presbyterians will catch at it, and runne away with it in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and where are you then, and I beleeve your own party will not con you much thanks, that have given the adverſary ſo great advantage. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it behoved you, (ſince you have laid the ſtrength of your cauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this word) to have demonſtrated by infallible arguments out of the Scripture, that the Church was at firſt governed by that kind of Presbytery you mean, which you have not done, before you pronounced all ſucceeding Churches corrupt and polluted becauſe they degenerated from that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. This is <hi>petitio principii,</hi> the fouleſt way of arguing. Thirdly, that the moſt learned and modeſt of the Prelacy, though they will grant you a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in the primitive Church, yet will never grant you, that from thence the Church ſhall be denominated Presbyterial; or that if it ſhould vary from thence, that therefore it had no more than the Sceleton, faſhion, face of a true Church. All theſe things ſhould have been better caſt up before you had been ſo poſitive.</p>
               <p>The degeneration then you dream of, is grounded upon a falſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that there was at firſt ſuch a Presbyterial or Combinational Church, that was conjoyn'd in any Church-Covenant beſide Baptiſme, that had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:115308:31"/>
the native power of the Keyes, &amp;c. which you never ſhall be able to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. The contrary to which <hi>Rutherford</hi> hath nervouſly prov'd, more particularly in his ſeventh Chapter of his peaceable and temperate plea, to whom I referre you. The ſumme of whoſe diſcourſe is, that there were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

From theſe then you can never prove that the following Church did degenerate, becauſe they were not.</p>
               <p>The manner of this degeneration you make gradual, and you give us in five ſteppes, deſcending from the Parochial till it came to the oecumenical Romane, as you call it. But ſuppoſing a degeneration in the degrees, you are miſtaken; for as I ſuppoſe the firſt ſhould be laſt, and the laſt firſt, which will appear, if we examine how the Church was govern'd from the Apoſtles times to this our unhappy age.

               <p n="1">1. THE firſt riſe of the rottening of the Church, was its falling from a pure poor Presbyterial Church, (which in reſpect of its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſtitution was made up of living ſtones, namely, lively Members, and laborious Miniſters, being firmly faſtened and united to the Lord Jeſus as their onely head by faith: one to another by a fraternal Covenant of love, according to the pattern that was propoſed and preſcribed in both Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaments, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 44.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5. <hi>Ezra</hi> 20.37. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.7, 10, 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13, 19, 22. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.2, 19. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.) into an impure and unpoliſhed paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Church: At that time when (ceaſing to elect and ordain a Teacher, a Paſtour, a Ruler, a Deacon and Diaconeſſe, or a Widow in conformity to the heavenly Canon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. and 15.4. and 16.1. compared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. and <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5, 6.) it was well content to admit and accept of a Parſon, a Vicar, a Warden, an Over-ſeer of the poor, and a Mid-wife. By which wiſdome of the fleſh, being no better then enmity againſt God, within a ſhort time after the dayes of the Apoſtles, Chriſts ſpiritual houſe and growing as well as living Temple, was turned and transformed into a carnal and dead Town or Apoſtatizing Pariſh. The very beginning and breeding of which Parochial Church is ſeen to have been in the time of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> one of them being an Elder of the Church at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and a diſciple of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, and the other a Paſtour at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and a diſciple of that <hi>Polycarp,</hi> as any man may eaſily perceive, that will peruſe what is to be obſerved in <hi>Euſebius</hi> Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory. 4. <hi>lib. c.</hi> 14.15, 16. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond degree of the Combinational Churches corruptions was the Cathedral Churches generation, which did preſume to alter, and to elevate the places and appellations of the Teacher, Paſtour, Ruler, and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115308:31"/>
Deacon, into thoſe unſcripture-like titles of Lord-Biſhop, Dean, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and Arch-Deacon, who ventur'd to uſurp the power of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Members and Miniſters of many Congregations in their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Councels, contrary to what was practic'd in that Orthodoxe pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.24. which is laid down and left as well for the imitation, as information of after-ages; whoſe work it was by Scripture-proofs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute ſoul ſubverting poſitions, and to confirme Chriſtian-doctrines, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of authority to cenſure any mans perſon, being that that is the expreſſe priviledge of the Presbyterial Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15.

               <p n="3">3. The third degree of the Presbyterial Churches degeneracy, was its climbing up to the ſtile of a Provincial Church, whoſe Paſtour was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frai'd nor aſham'd to aſſume the name and office of an Arch-Biſhop, and Metropolitane; leaving the ſervile and ſubſervient titles of <hi>Prebende, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate,</hi> and Vicar-general, as termes good enough to the inferiour Officers his underlings.

               <p n="4">4. The fourth famous degree of the Combinational Churches infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous defection, was its notably naughty enlarging it ſelf into a National Church; when, and whence without controverſie aroſe that Jewiſh imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and irregularly Religious obſervation of five frivolous and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſſe cuſtomes and traditions, of which the firſt was of National times, as the fifty yearly Feſtivals, or holy working-dayes, <hi>Curſed-Maſſe, Candle-Maſſe,</hi> &amp;c. The ſecond, was the National places, as the Conſecrated meeting houſes, Porches, Chancels, Church-yards. The third, was of National perſons, as the Univerſal Preachers, Office-Prieſts, Half-Prieſts, and Dioceſan Deacons. The fourth, was of National pious performances, as ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nted Worſhip, Quiriſters, ſinging of Pſalmes with the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique Poſtures. And the fifth was of National payments, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual profits, as offerings, tithes, and mortuaries; the which faithleſſe and fantaſtical faſhions were the illegitimate off-ſpring of National Parliaments in this and the Neighbour-Nations. Witneſſe the publick Acts, Statutes and other Ordinances in that behalf.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth and higheſt degree of Church-deformity, is the oecume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Church, otherwiſe call'd Romane Catholique; the which in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of I know not how many Kingdomes is the very beſt, though in

All this while my Atturney ſtood by, and ſmiled; I gueſſing what the truth was that he laughed at me, fumed and fretted the more; at which he let go the ſleider of his ſides, and burſt into an open laughter; this ſet me on fire to know what the cauſe ſhould be; but his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate bounds and curvets of laughing made ſuch ſtops and jumps in his words, that as yet I could perfectly underſtand nothing.

                  <p>Had I not been uſed to read from your party ſuch a bill as this againſt the Church, I ſhould have been as much moved at your charge, as I was at my <hi>Chancery</hi> bill; but I am now ſatisfied, 'tis <hi>pro formâ,</hi> it muſt be done, and ſo let it paſſe for this time. Though becauſe I know the particulars in it, you will expect an anſwer, I promiſe you to receive it in its due place.</p>
                  <p>To the whole, I ſay, you have not drawn up your bill aright; for ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the corruptions and deformities you mention, they ſtole not in upon the Church by thoſe degrees you have thought of. It was not the Pariſh that was firſt corrupted, then the Cathedral, after the Province, laſtly the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115308:32"/>
as for the Oecumenical Church I know none,, except the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative in a General Council, which whether it may be corrupted or no, is a diſpute of a high nature. Now. I ſhall ſet you right, that againſt you frame your bill next, you may proceed by a better method. The firſt Church in reſpect of Diſcipline was Cathedral, the next Parochial, the third Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, the fourth Provincial, and the laſt National; out of all theſe you may if you pleaſe, frame the Oecumenical. Now if you will fancie unto your ſelf corruptions, which I ſhall not deny you in Paradiſe, but altogether in the conſtitution, which is the true queſtion, you muſt proceed by theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and not by the former.</p>
                  <p>Now that this was the firſt conſtitution of the Church, even common reaſon ſhall informe and convince you. The Cathedral muſt needs be firſt, yea ſuppoſe it had been but only Congregational. (That you miſtake me not, do not think I ſpeak of a fabrick or a ſtately building, that came in after; for I ſpeak onely of ſome ſet place, City, or Town, or houſe if you will, where the people of God were gathered to worſhip him; put caſe <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, &amp;c.</hi>) This I ſay muſt needs be firſt; and becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in theſe greater Cities firſt gathered Chriſtians, and were in them for ſome time reſident, therefore theſe Cities had from thence their Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and were called <hi>Cathedra Petri, Cathera Jacobi, Cathedra Pauli, Cathedra Marci, &amp;c.</hi> which is no other than the place where any Apoſtle, or Apoſtolical man ſeated himſelf, and in that Sede, ſeat or place exerciſed Apoſtolical or Epiſcopal juriſdiction. <hi>Tertull.</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Apoſtoli pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo conteſtata fide in Jeſum Chriſtum per Judaeam, &amp; Eccleſiis inſtitutis: deinde in orbem profecti, eandem doctrinam ejuſdem fidei nationibus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgarunt, &amp; proinde Eccleſias apud unamquamque Civitatem condiderunt, à quibus traducem fidei &amp; ſemina doctrinae caetetae exinde Eccleſiae mutuatae ſunt, &amp; quotidie mutuantur ut Eccleſiae fiant, &amp;c.</hi> Tertull. <hi>de praeſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Chriſt was not angry when he gave the Keys, then he was pleaſ'd, then he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd to the world; he could not when he was thus affected with love, give them to the people in anger. The end he gave them was to purge his Church, to keep out ſcandals, to keep out Schiſmes, Errours, Hereſies out of his Church; but being in the peoples hands, by this means they are let in, and that not thinly, but in whole ſwarms. Deny if you can ſince the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have griped the Keyes, whether Arianiſme, Atheiſme, Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Montaniſme, Euthuſiaſme, Anabaptiſme, Familiſme, Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme, Chiliaſme, Socinianiſme, I want breath to reckon the reſt, hath not polluted, and to uſe your own word, rottened the Church? ſhall we ſay this government is from Chriſt which hath brought forth ſuch effects?

What ſhould I ſpeak that <hi>Mark</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who died ſix years before <hi>Peter,</hi> in whoſe Church there was a Presbytery? of <hi>Titus</hi> appointed Biſhop by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and left to ordain in the Iſland Presbyters, and to have juriſdiction? Of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite, the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Athens?</hi> Of <hi>Archippus</hi> at <hi>Coloſſe?</hi> Of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> at <hi>Philippi?</hi> Of <hi>Gaius</hi> at <hi>Theſſalonica?</hi> The Records were infinite that I could produce in this kinde. You ſee I have not inſtanced in any but ſuch who were Biſhops, <hi>viventibus &amp; videntibus &amp; approbantibus Apoſtolis,</hi> that ſo the truth may be apparent. I ſhall not therefore doubt to affirme that the government of the Apoſtolical Churches was by Biſhops, as ſuch who had the chief power, and that it was Ariſtocratical.</p>
                  <p>Neither can all the Arguments of the Presbyterians any whit enervate this; for you ſee I grant and prove a Presbytery; in theſe two onely lies the difference betwixt them and us. Firſt, that they would have a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles without a Biſhop, which I ſhall never grant, and I know they can never prove. Secondly, that the power of this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery without a Biſhop, ſhould be the moſt ſupreme in the Church, and that to it, without a Biſhop the Keyes were delivered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:115308:36"/>For this is it which I affirme, that originally the whole power was in the Apoſtles, and by them exerciſed where they ſetled no Biſhop. But to him, where they fixed a Biſhop, they committed their power; yet ſo, that ſo long as they liv'd it was but in ſubordination and dependency on them; for out of queſtion they might have govern'd alone; when therefore they gave any power to others, it was onely delegated, and they loſt not any of their own in giving orders. What therefore Biſhops were to the Apoſtles, that muſt needs all Presbyters ordain'd by the Biſhops be to them; voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſumed they were in <hi>partem ſollicitudinis &amp; reginimis,</hi> and had their power by delegation to aſſiſt in acts deliberative and conſiliary. But by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their order, they had no juriſdiction in cauſes criminal. For in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture there is not any commiſſion extant to meer Presbyters; there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of any power of Regiment in the Presbytery; no conſtitution A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical, that meer Presbyters ſhould alone, or without Biſhops govern; no example in Scripture of any cenſure inflicted by any meer Presbyters; no ſpecification of any power they had ſo to do. But the contrary to this may well be collected, becauſe to Churches where Colledges of Presbyters were reſident, Biſhops were ſent by Apoſtolical ordination; as <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Crete, Timothy</hi> to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the ſeven Angels to the ſeven Churches, with power of ordination, excommunication, and taking cognizance of cauſes and perſons, even of Presbyters themſelves, as is apparent in th Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and in the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And a more evident example cannot be given then in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> in both which were Presbyteries; but as then no conſtituted Biſhop: In one of which was an inceſtuous perſon, in the other diſorderly perſons; why did not theſe Presbyters then caſt them out? It was for want of coercive power; the Apoſtle as yet kept that power in his own hand, and therefore advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Theſſalonians, <hi>that if any man obey not his words,</hi>

                  <p>And that this was ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Presbyters power was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but dependent; not prime, but delegate, there be two teſtimonies;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115308:37"/>
the one in <hi>Ignatius,</hi> the other in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> which ſeems to me to evince it. <hi>Ignatius</hi> writes to his Church of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> being then in priſon in <hi>Rome;</hi> and he gives his Presbyters there this advice, that they rule the flock of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ignat. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch.</note> untill God ſhould declare who ſhould be their Paſtour. His words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The Presbyters were to feed or rule the flock, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> untill God ſhould ſhew and deſigne him, <hi>qui principatum habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus ſit,</hi> as <hi>Varlonius</hi> renders it, who to be their chief Paſtour.

                     </note> their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was at an end. The other teſtimony is that in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Candida, Numeria</hi> and <hi>Etecuſa,</hi> women that were accuſed to have fallen in the perſecution, and offered incenſe to Idols. Of theſe the Presbyters in the exile of <hi>Cyprian</hi> the Biſhop took the cognizance, and were ready to paſſe a ſentence upon them; <hi>Cyprian</hi> interpoſeth, and upon it, <hi>cauſa audita, perceperunt propoſiti eas tantiſper ſic eſſe,</hi> to remain in the ſtate they were, <hi>Donec Epiſcopus conſtituatur,</hi> untill the Biſhop ſhould be appointed. Here again, we ſee the verdict ſuſpended till there were a Biſhop, intimating that the prime power of juriſdiction and cenſure was in him, and that without him it might not be lawfully laid on. Nor do I ſee what can be anſwered to theſe two fathers.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have kept my ſelf within the bounds of the Scriptures, and out of them clearly demonſtrated as I ſuppoſe, that the firſt government of the Church was Ariſtocratical. It was in the Apoſtles and the Biſhops which they ſetled with their Presbyteries.</p>
                  <p>Now ſhould I deſcend lower, and ſhew the practice of the Church, eſpecially for the firſt three hundred years, I ſhould fill a volume; here I could tell you of thoſe famous Presbyteries of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in which <hi>Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>

                     <hi>Pantenus, Hieroclas,</hi> were the Presbyters of <hi>Rome;</hi> in which under <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> there were forty ſix Presbyters with many other Officers: Of <hi>Carthage</hi> in which under <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as appeares, in many of his Epiſtles which he writ to them in his exile, there were many Presbyters. Of <hi>Smyrna, Antioch, Philippi, Magneſia, Trullis</hi> and <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> all whoſe Presbyteries are remembred by <hi>Ignatius</hi> in the Epiſtles he writ to thoſe Churches. This is ſo clear, that it is written as it were with a Sunne beam, and it were ignorance and impudence to deny it. To which, if thoſe who ſo hotly contend for their Presbytery, would adde but theſe two things, which are as evident in Records, as is the Presbytery it ſelf; Firſt, that none of theſe Presbyters were Lay-Elders; and ſecondly, that after the Apoſtles dayes, there never was any Presbytery without a Biſhop, the conteſt were at an end.</p>
                  <p>One thing onely more I ſhall adde about theſe Presbyteries, that they never were erected but in the greater Cities, where the Patriarch, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, Metropolitane, or Dioceſan Biſhop had their ſeats, (pardon me if I ſpeak in the language of thoſe Ancient times) and therefore to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the Presbyters diſperſed in the leſſe Villages and Towns,<note place="margin">Conc.

                  <p>But methinks it were worth enquiry, how theſe Presbyteries that ſo long continued in the Church, became in difuſe; for I will not ſay they were ever aboliſh'd, in that I finde them in many Churches after the three hundredth year of Chriſt. I ſhall deliver what I conceive to be moſt probable; and I conjecture theſe to be the cauſes of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Upon the general prevailing of Chriſtianity, Synods began to aſſemble, and the Paſtours of divers Churches in theſe meetings conferr'd and agreed upon ſuch rules, as they thought needful to be obſerved in all their Churches, which they committed to the over-ſight of the Biſhops in their Dioceſſes; and in caſe they were negligent, the eſpecial ſuperviſion and execution was laid upon the Metropolitane; and if he were ſlack in doing what was enjoyn'd, an appeal was permitted to the Patriarch. This was the firſt occaſion that gave Presbyteries leave to play, by reaſon provincial Synods undertook the debating and reſolving thoſe doubts, and ordered thoſe difficulties which before troubled the Presbyteries. And rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it was, that the conſultation and determination of Synods ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before that of Presbyteries, as Courts of greater Judgment, higher power, better experience, and more indifferency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another reaſon may be, that when Emperours became Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, all thoſe civil caſes betwixt man and man, which were (to avoid the ſcandal that might ariſe by Law-ſuits among Chriſtians if tryed under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Judges) debated and ended in theſe Presbyteries, fell to be decided and adjudged in the Imperial Courts, and men had reaſon to repair to that ſeat of juſtice which had a ſword and power compulſory to force obſtinatemen to do right to any injur'd party, which the Church Court had not. When the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes grew leſſe, the leſſe reſpect was had to the Court and now the Presbytery having leſs to do, weakned &amp; mouldred away by little and little of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And yet I ſhall venture at a third reaſon. Upon the great peace which the Church enjoy'd, with the priviledges, immunities, and ample endowments granted by Chriſtian Emperours, Magnificent Temples, and goodly fabriques were erected for the publick ſervice of God; ſome there were before, but not ſo many, nor yet ſo beautiful. Theſe commonly were built where the Biſhops had their Seas, and were therefore after call'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches. In them the Biſhop at firſt with his Presbyters of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made his reſidence, and to his Court there kept the greater matters of

Found it was that in this Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery it was too eaſie a matter for the Biſhop to bear ſo great a ſway, that matters were ended often, as the man was by him friended. The dignities in that Church were in his donation, the dignified were his creatures, were ſubject to him, and many wayes might be diſpleaſed by him, if he would ſeek revenge. This being perceived, brought a great neglect and contempt upon the Presbyters. And the Biſhop taking his advantage thereby made uſe of his power, more than was fit. And if you ſhall ſay, that by this dore corruption entred into the Church, I ſhall not deny it. But then I ſhall rejoyn, that it was not the inſtitution; not in that the Church became Cathedral, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, or Provincial; not in that it was govern'd either by a Biſhop, a Metropolitane, a Primate, or a Patriarch with a Presbytery, and ſo was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocratical; but in that this juſt and regulated power was ill uſed. It was not the conſtitution of the Church that was corrupt, but the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and then lay the load upon the right horſe, and fly not violently in the face of your Mother.</p>

                  <p>He who would be quieted and ſatisfied about Church-government, I could adviſe him to ſearch this point to the depth; for otherwiſe he may be tranſported with ſtrange fancies.

How well the height of your conceits can endure to blemiſh and reproach ſo many religious and famous lights of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, I know not. What? all the old Fathers, all the zealous firſt Reformers, all blinde, in compariſon of your ſelves? for my part, I wiſh the Church of God in our dayes may have the grace for piety and prudence to follow their ſteps; and not to make the world believe, that all the ſervants of Chriſt before we liv'd, favoured and furthered the pride of Anti-Chriſt, till now in the fagge end of the world, when the faith of moſt men, and their love and charity are quench'd and decay'd; ſome new lights aroſe to reſtore the Church to that perfection of diſcipline, which the Apoſtles never mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Ancient fathers and Councils never remembred, the Univerſal Church of Chriſt before us never conceived, nor our chief Reformers never imagined: for they have as you have heard, delineated and commended the old way of diſcipline.</p>

                     </gap>e I end my general anſwer, I muſt remove one block which ſome have caſt in my way. For I have heard it objected that theſe Patriarchs were Independents, which I confeſſe in ſome ſenſe is true, becauſe one Patriarch was not to intermeddle in the juriſdiction of another; the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Church having ſet out the extent of their Provinces, and limited their power. But this will make nothing for the preſent Independency of Combinational Churches; for they had Churches, many Metropolitan ſees, many Dioceſſes under their power and over-ſight. But theſe have but one ſingle Congregation. Thoſe could call Synods through their whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and puniſh any Biſhop or Church-man or other under them: An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115308:41"/>
dependent Church can call no Synod, nor puniſh nor reforme any member that is not of their own ſociety or Combination. Thoſe were not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neither, but they were bound upon their elections to informe their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Patriarchs, and by theit communicatory letters to give accompt of it, and of their faith: The Paſtours of the Combinational Churches are not accomptable to any ſiſter-Church. Laſtly, put caſe, as it ſometimes fell out, that Factions, that Schiſmes, that Hereſies aroſe in their Patriarchates, the Church was not left remedileſſe; for the Patriarch or Church being not able to quell, compoſe, or extirpate them, a General Council was call'd to which they were all inferiour, and to whoſe verdict they were bound to ſtand, as is evident in the caſe of <hi>Neſtorius, Dioſcorus,</hi> &amp;c. who were depoſ'd by general Councils, and their Hereſies condemned; and the like may be ſaid of <hi>Arrius</hi> and <hi>Eutiches,</hi> condemn'd in general Councils; which ſhews that the general Council was the ſupreme judicature, and that the Patriarchs had their dependence on it, and ſo were not abſolute Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents. Now for the calling of theſe and other Councils, they had their warrant and pattern from the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. who to redreſſe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention then aroſe in the Church, call'd that Synod to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it.</p>

No Synod can impoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees upon any Combinational Church; That's your own Maxime. But this Synod did impoſe her Decrees upon thoſe Churches which you ſay were Combinational: This propoſition is evident in the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and <hi>verſe</hi> 22, and 35.

                  <p>I have you ſee laid the foundation of the Churches government in Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy, of which Monarchy and Democracy are the extremes.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115308:42"/>
learned Rabbies the Jeſuites plead ſtifly for it. But then you muſt not take that way you do to prove it; for the erection of Cathedral, Parochial, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan, Provincial and National Churches through his Patriarchate will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do it; Since theſe were from the beginning in other Patriarchates, and in his too, when no Monarchy was ever dream'd of or challeng'd. That his challenge I acknowledge to be a corruption.</p>
                  <p>And if any Church ſhall affect Democracy, I ſhall ſay it is corrupted alſo; in that it obſerves not that Apoſtolical rule of government and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which was then uſed, as I have demonſtrated. It is then a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in you, to make the Presbyterial or Combinational Church to be the ſole pure and Apoſtolical Church; and that all Churches that are fallen off from that government are corrupted. This if you can confirme fairely and firmly by unanſwerable arguments as you make ſhew of, then you have reaſon to faſten your degeneration and corruption on Cathedrals, Pariſhes, Dioceſſes, Provinces and Nations; but if this can never be done, as I am aſſured it cannot, then I ſhall affirme, that the caſting the Church into Cathedrals, Pariſhes, &amp;c. was not errour, ſince by that the diſcipline of the Church might be better adminiſtred, and the Ariſtocratical government far advanced and furthered.</p>

                  <p>Which ſhall further appear, if we ſhall diſtinguiſh of the terme Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, which I hinted at firſt; for as among Logical notions there be <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini primi,</hi> and <hi>à primo orti,</hi> ſo alſo it is in this; the word Cathedral being taken in a primitive and in a derivative ſenſe. If you take it in the prime ſenſe, it denotes unto us thoſe places or chief Cities where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for ſome time, or Apoſtolical men by their appointment took up their reſidence for converſion of the people, and reglement of the Church; hence it is, that we ſo often read of in the fathers <hi>Cathedra Jacobi,</hi> which was at <hi>Jeruſalem; Cathedra Petri,</hi> which was for ſeven years at <hi>Antioch;</hi> after at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and laſt of all, <hi>Cathedra Apoſtolorum Petri &amp; Pauli</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> In thoſe Churches where they ſtaid for any long time and preach'd, and planted Religion, which were commonly the Metropolis of that Province or Country, as <hi>Epheſus, Corinth, Philippi,</hi> at their departure, they left a Biſhop with a Presbytery to govern, and thence theſe Churches were call'd <hi>Eccleſiae Cathedrales.</hi> This is the prime importance of the word. But

after as Chriſtianity was extended, and Biſhops were ſeated and erected in divers Dioceſſes they began to build Churches, in which at firſt the Biſhop and the Presbyters did reſide, who were to over-ſee the Dioceſſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their reſidence in this place, the Church in imitation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Chairs, was call'd the Cathedral Church.

He commended the young man to the chief of all the Biſhops, (can any man think he was leſſe than a Metropolitane?) the man prov'd deboiſt, ran from the Church and became a thief. At his return, <hi>John</hi> demanded of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop his charge; the Biſhop ſobbing and ſighing ſaid, he is dead, dead to God, for he is become wicked and pernicious, and to be ſhort a Thief; for he keeps this Mountain over againſt this Church together with his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; 'tis more then probable this was a Material Church; for how elſe could the hill be over againſt it? and preſently it is ſaid, that the Apoſtle haſtened out of the Church. Now I judge it to be Cathedral, becauſe he that was the chief of the Biſhops had his reſidence in it.

They were then before, and were but now again erected. And we of all other have leaſt reaſon to doubt of this, ſince <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> erected a Church at <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> as the beſt of our Hiſtorians record,<note place="margin">Gildas, Spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Cambden.</note> and <hi>Spilman</hi> hath in picture given us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and faſhion, and materials of it. After, divers other Cathedral Churches were erected in this Iſland by King <hi>Lucius,</hi> if there be any truth in our Records, at <hi>Landaff,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> &amp;c. as you may read in <hi>Ephraim, Pagetts Chriſtianography,</hi> part 3. page 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now take the Cathedral in which of theſe acceptions you pleaſe, your aſſertion cannot have any truth in it. Not in the firſt; for then you make the Apoſtles the authours of this corruption, ſince they were the erectors of theſe Cathedrals; not in the laſt, becauſe they were erected after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical patterne. The plain truth is, that the corruption of the Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional was not in the erection of either, becauſe the combinational never was before either. What was it precedent to Saint <hi>James</hi> his <hi>Cathedra</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem?</hi>

I marvail when it ſhould begin? His was then ſet up before the Apoſtles departed to preach to the whole world, and under him it is not poſſible to conceive the Church could be Combinational;<note place="margin">Acts 1. &amp; 2. Acts 4.41. Acts 4.4. Acts 5.14. Acts 6.1.</note> for upon neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in that Church at that time there muſt be more than one Congregation; for from 120. to 3120. to theſe were added 5000. which makes 8120. and yet more multitudes of men and women were added, and ſtill the number of diſciples were multiplied. And out of doubt the increaſe ſtaid not here, <hi>God adding to the Church dayly ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> That ſo many thouſands ſhould meet together in any houſe to performe their Chriſtian duties was impoſſible; they muſt be divided into ſeveral Congregations, Had theſe been Combinational, then Saint <hi>James</hi> had been by the Apoſtles made Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to little purpoſe; for he could nor muſt not have taken the over-ſight but of one of them, the reſt had been out of his juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I ſuppoſe no wiſe man will ever think, ſince the Apoſtles no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion had the ſame charity, and would have the ſame care of the reſt, as of that one, and then would have ſet up as many chaires as there had been Congregations. But of ſuch we hear not, of this one we do, which is a ſufficient evidence to me, that all the Chriſtians of that City at leaſt, if not of all <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> were under his juriſdiction, and ſubject to his <hi>Cathedra.</hi> Out of which it will neceſſarily follow, That the Cathedral Church was the prime inſtitution, not the Combinational, and that therefore the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>national Churches corruption, was not the Cathedrals generation, but rather the contrary, which we have lived to ſee, that the Combinationals generation, is the Cathedrals corruption.</p>
                  <p>And what I have ſaid in particular of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is as true of all other Churches the Apoſtles planted, and in others planted by their patterne, <hi>Antioch, Corinth, Atheus, Rome, &amp;c.</hi> for the ſame reaſon holds in all theſe Cities where the multitudes of beleevers grew ſo numerous; one Congregation could not hold them. I aske now, had the Apoſtles, put caſe <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> there preſent, had they juriſdiction over them all, or had they not? If they had, then the Combination and Independency of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is at an end in the Primitive Church. If they had not, I wonder they ſhould ſtay for divers years in one place, having no more to do, than to ſuperviſe one ſingle Congregation; beſides, that then there muſt be as many as there were Paſtours in thoſe Churches of equal power in their ſeveral Churches with the Apoſtles, which he that can beleeve, may digeſt any thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Epheſus</hi> was a great City,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.3.</note> and had in it thoſe who took upon them to ſay they were Apoſtles, the Angel (be it Biſhop or Colledge of Presbyters) is commended for trying them, and finding them lyers; if they were not of his own Congregation, what had the Angel to do to try them? if your Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net be true, he deſerves no commendation at all, but rather reproof for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. But that they were, is more than ever you can prove. I am apt to beleeve, that if it had been ſo, the Epiſtle had not been directed to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but to the Angel of ſuch or ſuch a Congregation in <hi>Epheſus.</hi>

                  <p>This that I have ſaid deſtroyes clearly the ſubject of your Propoſition, the Combinational Church, and that being gone, what you affirme of it will fall of it ſelf.

                  <p n="2">2. Next to your Diſtribution I ſay, that perhaps by Teachers and Paſtors you may intend two ſorts of Miniſters in the Church; for ſo I know ſome diſtinguiſh, that Paſtours in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were ſuch as had not onely the office to preach the Word and adminiſter the Sacraments, but had alſo the Church and care of ſouls committed to them; Teachers, thoſe who laboured in the Doctrine, but received no charge of Sacraments or ſouls. Some make the Teachers to be publike profeſſors of Divinity, and Governours of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115308:44"/>
Schooles; but Paſtours, to be the Miniſters of particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I will not deny but it may be true; but I ſhall remember you that four of the Fathers, <hi>Jerome, Auſtin, Chryſoſtome, Theodoret,</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with the nicetie; for they thought the Apoſtle expreſſ'd what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Paſtoral office under two names, that the Paſtour was to be Doctour, to remember he muſt labour in doctrine, as well as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which often ſignifies to rule. And then your third word Rulers will come under that notion alſo, and ſo Teachers, Paſtours and Rulers will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note three diſtinct ſorts of Church Officers, which I have ſome reaſon to think you aime at, but one and the ſame man qualified both to teach and to rule. At <hi>Geneva, Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> were made both Paſtours and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Divinity, being men ſo able to diſcharge both; and yet no man did ſay, that they did not content themſelves with their paſtoral votation, or alledge againſt them, He that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhortation. For as I have often told you, and have proved, Lay-Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders, except you mean Arbitratours, there were never any in the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>The laſt word you uſe is Deacon.<note place="margin">Hieron. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagrium.

                  <p>I ſhall therefore willingly admit of the diſtinction, that there were in the Primitive Church two ſorts of Deacons.

to it,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6, 7.</note> amplifying the great love of Chriſt dying for us. Scarcely for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man will one dye, yet peradventure for a good man, ſome would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dare to dye; the gradation is this.

A man is a Ruler of an Army, and he ſhall not call ſome Majors, ſome Colonells, ſome Centurions, Pentacuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Decurions, &amp;c. becauſe theſe are unſcripture-like titles. <hi>Nomen</hi> is <hi>rei notamen,</hi> invented it was to denote the thing, neither do I know which way it is poſſible to underſtand and diſtinguiſh but by names; <hi>vox</hi> being <hi>rei &amp; conceptuum ſignum;</hi> and therefore muſt neceſſarily be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if we will not confound our ſelves in the underſtanding of things. But now to the names you mention, Lord-Biſhop, Dean, Chancellour, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, Arch-Deacon. The end of two of theſe, I finde in Scripture, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Deacon; but you'll ſay the ſyllables, Lord and Arch, are unſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-like. I muſt confeſſe, that I finde not Lord before Biſhop in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor Arch before Deacon; but this will not prove that we have alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the places and appellations: for what place have we altered either of Biſhops or Deacons, by calling one Lord-Biſhop, or the other Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con? Still the place and office is the ſame; for the Lord-Biſhop hath no other power than he had at firſt, which is <hi>poteſtas clavium;</hi> nor the Arch-Deacon any more than he had, to be <hi>oculus Epiſcopi,</hi> and ſee that all be well adminiſtred that concerns the poor, and ſervice of the Church. To be offended with a title is to pick ſtraws, eſpecially when the ſubſtance is obſerved.</p>
                  <p>For how have we alter'd the places, when we have yet in our Church Biſhops, who are Paſtours, Teachers, and beſides theſe publick Profeſſours of Divinity, Doctours, Catechizers, whom Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> meant by Teachers, ſuch as were in the Churches of <hi>Alexandria, Clemens, Pantonus, Origen, Hicroclas.</hi> As for thoſe other three appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Dean, Chancellour, Surrogate, no Scripture can be brought for them, nor needs it, it being lawful, no queſtion, to give fit names to things, though no text can be produced; otherwiſe your parties were to ſeek, who call him who is to preſide in a Synod by the name of a Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quutor, and thoſe that govern in your Combinational Churches Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and are not theſe unſcripture-like? for I finde no ſuch titles in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                  <p>As for the name of Deane, it is ancient, and it ſignifies no more than that Presbyter who was the chief in any Collegiate Church, and was to have a care that the Statutes of the Church were obſerved, being like the the Principal Warden or Preſident of a College, and you may as well be offended with any of theſe Appellations as with this, with which yet it is evident many of your party are well pleaſed, for they enjoy it, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profits, notwithſtanding the names are not found in Scripture. And ſhould any man lay this objection againſt any of them, I dare ſay he would

This being a confeſſed rule in the Law, that when any cauſe is committed to any man, he is alſo conceived to receive full authority in all matters belonging to that cauſe. When the Emperours became Chriſtian, they judged it equal and pious to reſerve ſome cauſes to be tried in the Chriſtian Court, in which they conſtituted the Biſhop to be the Judge.

                        <hi>Cooks</hi> Reports fol. 8.</note> Rites of Matrimony, Probates of Wills, Divorces, and ſuch like. To give audience to theſe, the Biſhop otherwiſe imployed, could not alway be preſent; and yet there was no reaſon that for his abſence juſtice ſhould not take its courſe. And in ſome of theſe had he been preſent, great skill in Civil Lawes is requiſite, that they be ended aright. This gave occaſion to the Biſhop to appoint his Chancellour and Surrogate. A Chancellour (who had his name <hi>à Cancellis</hi> within which he was to ſit) a man brought up in the Civil Lawes, and therefore fit to decide ſuch cauſes that did depend upon thoſe Lawes, who being at firſt a meere Lay-man, and therefore having no power of Exommunication, therefore the Biſhop thought fit to adjoyne a Surrogate to him, that in caſe that high cenſure were to be paſſed, this man being in Orders, and therefore inveſted with power, <hi>actu primo,</hi> and by Commiſſion with the Biſhops power <hi>actu ſecundo ſub Epiſcopo rogatus,</hi> being demanded, and an Officer under the Biſhop,<note place="margin">Actu primo.</note> might pronounce the Sentence. This was the original of their names and power. Now prudential neceſſity firſt inſtituted them, and prudence where Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power is of force continues them. If a Superiour ſhall be pleaſed to revoke ſome of theſe cauſes, which were by him made of Eccleſiaſtical cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, and cauſe the litigants to take their trial at Common or Civil Law,<note place="margin">

And if the reſt ſhall be tried by the Biſhop and his Presbytery, as they were at firſt, neither will there need much a Surrogate. But now if that rule of the Presbytery ſhould prove to be true, who do challenge cogniſance of all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoever, which are ſins directly, or by reduction, then they have power, if not to nullifie, yet to give liberty to play, all Courts and Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories

Neither was he choſen to that place by the Patriarch, but came to it by ſeniority; the name then gave him no power, but onely this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to be chief of the Deacons of the Church, as if you would ſay of the eldeſt ſtanding. In the Church of <hi>England</hi> he was more than a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, for he was a Presbyter, and his office was to be preſent at all ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to enquire into the life, the manners, the abilities, and ſufficiency of him who was to be ordained, and either to reject him if he ſaw occaſion, or to preſent him to the Biſhop to be ordained, to induct into any Benefice that man who was inſtituted by the Biſhop, to have the care of the houſes of God were kept decent, and in good repair: laſtly, to take account of all who had to do with the poors money. And this laſt was it which gave him the name of the chief Deacon;<note place="margin">Ambr. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de off. c.</hi> 41.

For I ſhall here ask, whether the Biſhops being not aſſembled in Synods or Councils had power to excommunicate or no? If you ſay they had, then it will ſeem ſtrange that meeting in Synods and Councils they ſhould loſe this power.

                  <p>From the Apoſtles I deſcend lower. Firſt, to the Angels of the Churches, who were commended for not bearing with them that were evil; and for trying them who ſaid they were Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Revel. 2.2.6.20. 1 Tim. 5.19, 20 21, 22. Tit. 3.10.</note> but found upon tryal ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars: and again, blamed when they neglected their duties. They were neither worthy of praiſe, nor yet blame-worthy, had they not had authority in their hands. <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to do the like at <hi>Epheſus, Titus</hi> at <hi>Crete.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, but perhaps it may be replyed, theſe directions were not given to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as ſingle Biſhops, but as chief of a Presbytery: well then, the concluſion will hence eaſily follow, that a Biſhop with his Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery may excommunicate. If ſo, then I pray tell me, what uſurpation it can be for Biſhops aſſembled in a Synod or Council to do the like? They being chief cannot want that authority which the Presbytery hath; and why then ſhould they not uſe it? From an inferiour to a ſuperiour power, the argument follows ſtrongly. The Juſtices may puniſh ſuch or ſuch a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, much more the Judges, but much more the Superiour that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred them. The reaſon is the ſame; The Biſhop with the Presbytery may caſt a ſcandalous perſon out of the Church, therefore much more the Biſhops themſelves aſſembled in Councils, becauſe among them there is a ſubordination. And what a leſſer power may do, that a higher may, which is empowred to that end. Thus have I wreſtled with your aſſertion, and foil'd it. I come next to grapple with your reaſon, and if that prove to be weak, your affirmation will fall of it ſelf. You ſay,</p>

                     </gap>, I judge or give ſentence. Thirdly, There ought to be a Preſident in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, who is to moderate the whole action, and to pronounce the ſentence. Fourthly, That the Synodical decrees materially and Eccleſiaſtically are obligatory,<note place="margin">Ver. 22.23. Acts 16.4.

But this was not the ſole end; for another there was; <hi>viz.</hi> to caſt out of the Church, Diſturbers and Hereticks, as I ſhall by and by make good unto you: and ſo your poſition of uſurpation in Biſhops of the rod will not prove true.</p>
                  <p>But this you ſay, was contrary to the orthodox pattern; how ſo I pray? if a contrariety, then it muſt be oppoſite, and I have never yet heard, that ſubordinate ends come under any ſpecies of oppoſition. A man bindes his ſon Prentice, his end is, that he learn and be skilful in his profeſſion, but yet he hath a farther reach, which is, that he may get a livelyhood; the firſt he intends leſſe principally, the laſt chiefly; and can a man ſay now, that theſe two ends are contrary, or thwart one the other, when indeed they are but ſubſervient the one to the other? and the like is to be ſaid of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate ends. For that rule of the Civilians is moſt true, <hi>finis principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis non tollit acceſſorium;</hi> to apply this, the chief end of the Apoſtolical Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod was to confute falſe poſitions, and eſtabliſh the truth; ſuppoſe now, that they had there pronounced an Anathema againſt thoſe Jewiſh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who would be ſtill zealous for circumciſion and the obſervation of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law after the publication of their decree, had this been contrary and oppoſite to their firſt and prime intent? you cannot ſay it. Neither is it then contrary, when a company of Biſhops meet in a Synod or Council to illuſtrate and hold forth the truth, and condemn hereſies, that they paſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a cenſure upon the Hereticks. I can finde no contrariety or oppoſition in this. Yea, but you'll ſay, here's no pattern for it. Neither is it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; it ſufficeth that here is a pattern ſet to compaſſe the chief end of all Councils; as for the acceſſories they may be regulated by prudence. A Prince calls a Parliament; in it there be good Laws eſtabliſhed for the peace of his Territories, and not one delinquent puniſhed or cenſured. Muſt this particular Seſſion be ſuch an abſolute pattern to all following Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that ſhall onely make good Laws, and never call to queſtion, or paſſe ſentence upon any offender? I hope you will not ſay ſo; neither can you ſay it in this caſe. For I find the Apoſtles ſingly, as I have proved, and out of Council to have done it; and therefore I doubt not, that if being in

                     <hi>Propoſition 5.</hi> To cenſure any mans perſon, is the expreſſe priviledge of the Presbyterial Church, <hi>1 Cor. 5.4, 5. 2 Theſ. 3.15.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>PRiviledges and Prerogatives are tender things; and it behoves thoſe who ſtand for them, to produce infallible Records, leſt it appear their claim be louder than their right. A Corporation ſtruggles hard for a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, fees a Lawyer to plead their Charter; he picks out ſome weak words in it that may look that way; at laſt the Judge tells him, that he hath betrayed his Clients cauſe, for the words in the Charter carry no ſuch meaning. The like I muſt ſay to you; A priviledge you plead, for your Corps the Presbyterial Church; the evidence you give for it, is out of Gods great Charter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. Now if you had ſtudied to betray your caſe, you could not I believe have lighted upon two more weake evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
                  <p>For doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſſert a priviledge of the Presbyterial Church in that place of the Corinths, where he makes himſelf the Judge; where he paſſeth cenſure himſelf? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I have decreed or judged? he asketh not their conſents, he prayeth not their aid, he referreth not the matter to their liking; I have ſaith he, already determined, afore he wrote, and before they read that part of his Epiſtle. And what to do? to joyne with them, to deliver this treſpaſſer to Satan! No ſaith he, I have already decreed to deliver him. By what means? what, by their power and priviledge? not ſo, but by the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Then for ought we can finde in this place, the Apoſtle though abſent, decreed to do the deed himſelf, by the power of Chriſt, and not by the conſent and help of the Corinthians. Certainly had this been a Priviledge of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Church, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would never have invaded it; what an Apoſtle guilty of ſuch preſumption, ſuch uſurpation?</p>
                  <p>Yea, but the ſentence was to be pronounced by them. When ye are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> my power, my authority, then deliver. True, they were bound to do it; but by what right? their own, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles? by his certainly, for it is In my ſpirit. So all their power is delegate, not native; 'tis derivative, not primitive; declarative, not judiciary, and conſequently from this place no priviledge of the Presbyterial Church to cenſure any mans perſon can be deduced. But rather the quite contrary, in that the Apoſtle a ſingle perſon judged and decreed without them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall mind you what may well be concluded hence, which is, that the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould not be paſt in a corner, but in a full Aſſembly, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>When ye are gathered together;</hi> and if you ſhall complaine that it was otherwiſe, I ſhall not ſtick to confeſſe that your complaint is juſt,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115308:50"/>
and I have and ſhall ever joyn with you in it.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall adde what ſtrength I can to your plea out of this chapter. Some may ſay the authority was in the Presbyterial Church, becauſe the Apoſtle reprehends them, <hi>verſe</hi> 2. that they had not paſt cenſures on the peccant. <hi>Ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed may be taken from you.</hi> That I may give light to this dark place; A cuſtome was uſed in the Church, when any was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, to joyn in mourning. This duty the Corinthians had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and he reproves them for it; they were puffed up in an opinion of their own deeper wiſdome, they joyned not in mourning; they complained not to Chriſt or his Apoſtle, that a Cenſure might paſſe on ſuch a one. This was their fault; for a courſe they ſhould have taken, that ſuch a one ſhould be taken away. But by whom? that's the queſtion; Not by them to be ſure. For Taken away from you, implies that it is by the power of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, not by their act; for no man can take any thing from himſelf. He may put it away, not take it; the expreſſion had been veen very imperfect if this had been the meaning. And ſo for you nothing can be included hence.</p>
                  <p>But again, it may be objected, <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Purge ye out the old leaven.</hi> And again, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Do ye not judge theſe who are within?</hi> where pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and judging is laid upon <hi>vos,</hi> and is therefore a Church-priviledge.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that <hi>vos</hi> is no way excluſive of the Apoſtles power, but rather includes it; for ſure he may judge them that are within the Church, and doth it, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>Vos</hi> then hath reference to this third verſe. <hi>Vos</hi> you ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in my Spirit, do you purge out the old leaven? do you judge thoſe who are within? You to whom the Keys are given, you to whom I have delegated, my power, being of the Presbytery, not the Layity; do you judge and purge. This is the clear intent of the Apoſtle, and ſo hath been given by all ancient Interpreters. Whence it will follow, that a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial priviledge to excommunicate can have no footing in this chapter.</p>
                  <p>As for that other place, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.15. it gives no countenance at all to the Presbyterial Church for Cenſure. For the Apoſtle gives order onely about a diſorderly perſon, that he might be ſignified to him by a letter, that if occaſion required he might be cenſured; yea, in expreſſe termes forbids them to Cenſure him.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.17.</note> For he ſaith, <hi>Count him not as an enemy,</hi> that is, as an Heathen. (for ſo the word <hi>enemy</hi> probably ſignifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> 2.16.) I muſt confeſſe ingenuouſly unto you, if I would pick out an argument againſt the Presbyterial priviledge to cenſure, I would make choiſe of this place; for to what purpoſe would the Apoſtle have this unruly man noted by a letter, if they had power to proceed againſt him? Now why nor they nor the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had not power without the Apoſtle to Cenſure, I have given you an account before, and need not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it.</p>
                  <p>You ſee you muſt produce ſtronger evidence for your priviledge than hitherto you have done, before I can yield it. And I am confident that better you cannot bring forth. Since the power of Cenſures muſt be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115308:50"/>
in ſome hands, I ſhall leave them in theirs that they have beene for ſixteen hundred years; Primarily in Biſhops by commiſſion and delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Presbyters, and therefore much more in both aſſembled in Councils, ſo that it cannot be any preſumption or uſurpation of power, if in them they uſe their authority to cenſure any mans perſon; of which you aſſign the time to be <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 320. or thereabout when</p>

In relation of which ſtory, you are not exact enough neither. For I read not of any power that <hi>Alexander</hi> uſurped over <hi>Euſebius,</hi> nor any Cenſure he paſſed upon him; he wrote in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a letter to the brethren of the Churches, that they ſhould beware of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and his Arianiſme, becauſe he was the patron and ringleader of the Apoſtates; in his letter he ſharply reproved him, but he cenſured him not, neither indeed could he, becauſe he belonged to the juriſdſction of another Patriarch. But touching <hi>Arius</hi> and his adherents, he ſummoned together a Council of many Biſhops, and deprived him and ſuch as favoured his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>Achillas, Aeithales, Carpomes</hi> a ſecond <hi>Arius,</hi> &amp;c. of the Prieſtly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

                     <hi>1.</hi> You ſay, That the Presbyterial Church in reſpect of its Primitive conſtitution, was compoſed and made up of living ſtones, namely, lively members, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>NOw here I muſt put you in minde of an old Proverb, <hi>Cantherius in porta.</hi> For you ſtumble in your firſt ſetting out, and go about to impoſe upon me by a fallacy, which if you will not grant, I ſhall clearly deny your deſcription; for you diſcourſe <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid, ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am confident you will not deny but your Presbytyrial Church is a part of Chriſts Militant Church, viſible with us on earth. And that is compared to a Net, in which be good and bad fiſh; to a field, in which are wheat and tares; to a Barn-floor, in which is Corn and Chaffe; to a houſe, in which are veſſels of honour and diſhonour. Your viſible Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Church for ought I know then muſt be like all other Churches; have in it profeſſours, as well as true beleevers; hypocrites, as well as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhippers: which if you ſhould deny, I would ask you whether the Church <hi>Acts</hi> 2. or any that the Apoſtles planted, were Presbyterial Churches or not. If they were not, there was never any; if they were, then there may be hypocrites and profane perſons in them. For in thoſe we read of <hi>Ananias, Sapphyra, Simon Magus, Hymineus, Alexander, Demas, Diotrophes,</hi> the Nicolaitans, and thoſe that ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not. How then was the Primitive Church compoſed and made up of none but living ſtones?</p>
                  <p>Here then lies the fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid.</hi> The Church in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Elect, who to us are inviſible, that belong unto the myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, is compoſed of living ſtones, namely, lively members, &amp;c. and thus much thoſe texts you produce very ſtrongly prove. But the Church as it is Militant and viſible of which you muſt ſpeak, becauſe you ſpeak of a Presbyterial Church, comprehends all ſorts in it, who though they be true, real and univocal parts of the viſible body, yet they are but aequivocal parts of the myſtical, and to them your deſcription belongs not. To argue then from the part to the whole, is a fallacy. Some in the Presbyterial Church are living ſtones, therefore the whole Presbyterial Church is in its Primitive conſtitution compoſed of theſe, is fallacious.</p>
                  <p>We grant that it were earneſtly to be wiſh'd, and all lawful means would be diligently uſed both by Paſtour and people, to have all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Church moſt holy and gracious. But to ſay a Church hath no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115308:53"/>
right conſtitution where all the members are not ſuch, is a foule er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                  <p>For never yet was their any Church of ſuch a conſtitution; not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtical under the fathers, not the Jewiſh or National under <hi>Moſes,</hi> not the Chriſtian under the Apoſtles themſelves, and therefore aſſume not that to your Presbyterial Church, which yet never was in any, nor never ſhall be. All Churches as viſible, conſiſt of heterogeneous parts, and ſo doth yours; which if it ſhould marre the conſtitution of a Church, it muſt needs marre yours as well as others. For I hope you will not ſay, that all yours are Saints more than by calling, and ſo are all Chriſtians, even thoſe at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> and all,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.2. Cap. 1.12, 13. cap. 5.1. cap. 6.15. cap. 11.21. cap. 15.35. cap. 8.12, 13.</note> among whom yet were ſchiſmatical and contentious perſons, envying and ſtrife, inceſt, and inceſt tolerated, going to Law with their brethren, Harlotry, coming to the Lords Table drunk, a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a fundamental point of ſaith, the reſurrection, little charity to the weak brother. Now then if <hi>Corinth</hi> were a Presbyterial Church, certainly in the Primitive conſtitution it was not compoſed of living ſtones onely, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, to the conſtitution of a Church there can be but two things required; the <hi>materiale,</hi> and the <hi>formale;</hi> the matter, are a people gathered and united, called by the Word to live in a divine policy under Chriſt their head. The forme that unites them to him, is as you ſay rightly, faith and charity. That they be truly and indeed united to him, requiſite it is that their faith be lively working by love. But that they be united to the body the viſible Church, which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there is no more, nor can be no more expected, but that they make outwardly a profeſſion of faith, and fraternal love. For whether either be true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned and ſincere or no, we can never know, and ſhould we ſtay till thoſe were manifeſt unto us, it would be long enough before we ſhould conſtitute our's, or you your Church: pray take this better into your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.

                  <p>TO which I have this to ſay. Firſt, that if this poſition be true, then <hi>Ameſius</hi> was miſtaken,<note place="margin">Ameſ. Med. l. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>39.</hi> Sect. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> who makes a Combinational Church all one with a Parochial. He tells us there of a Church inſtituted by God, and ſaith, that it was not National, Provincial, nor Dioceſan, but <hi>Parochia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, vel unius Congregationis, cujus membra inter ſe combinantur, &amp; ordinarie couveniunt in eodem loco ad publicum Religionis exercitium.</hi> If you ſhall ſay, that this kind of Parochial Church differs from ours at this day, becauſe it is combined in Covenant, which ours is not: I grant it: but adde, that ſuch a Combination is not neceſſary. For I know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant requiſite, but that in Baptiſme to make a man a member of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115308:53"/>
any Church, as I formerly proved unto you. Neither can you give any one inſtance of any ſuch Covenant before your time, was taken by any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Church in <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall here again put you in minde of that I intimated at firſt, about this word <hi>Parochia,</hi> and give you farther light in it. For <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> hath a double acception, eirher as it was at firſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Selden.</hi> of tyths, <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.</note> or as it is uſed in our dayes. At firſt the word <hi>Parochia</hi> denoted a whole Biſhoprick (which is but a greater Pariſh) and ſignified no other than a Dioceſſe. That in theſe there were Towns and Villages cannot be denyed; for the proof of this we need but run over the names of Cities, Towns, &amp;c. of <hi>Judea</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Old and New Teſtament, and all plantations will teach us, that in proceſſe of time it comes to be thus; at firſt in greater Cities, then in theſe Religion was planted. Among theſe it cannot be well conceived, that the whole hamlet was at once converted, but it muſt be done by little and little, till at laſt the whole Townſhip received the faith. Together then they met for the ſervice of God, and as the Jewes in their ſeveral Towns had to that purpoſe their Synagogues; ſo Chriſtians began to think of conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places, where they might meet to this purpoſe, (as you in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) they built them Churches, and ſo from meeting in private houſes, they met in theſe. Where yet they entered not into a Combination to be an abſolute and Independent Congregation, but did depend on the chief Church, where the Biſhop was reſident; and this is evident, by what I ſhall now ſay. The Paſtours of theſe Pariſhes were ſuch as the Biſhop ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed under him to have care of ſouls in them; and thoſe are they,<note place="margin">

All that was received in the Biſhoprick, was as a common treaſury to be thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed; one part of it was allowed the maintenance of the Miniſtry; another, to the relief of the poor, ſick and ſtrangers; a third,<note place="margin">Conc.

Ceaſing to do any thing, preſuppoſeth that there was a time when one might or did do it: Now it behoveth you to ſhew the time when Pariſhes in general, (for particulars will make no rule, and few, very few are to be given;) did ever elect their Paſtour. I am ſure to ordain him, in antiquity you can produce not one example. 'Tis not poſſible, ſince the Records of the Church are open, and he that runnes may read them; that at firſt the Teacher and Paſtour ſent to any Church, was ſent and there placed by the Biſhop. The inſtances are ſo many, and the practice of the Church ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that it were loſt labour to produce them; yet here I ſhall ask you onely one queſtion; if this were a corruption, I wonder why by your pure Presbyterial Church it is retained? why are men now elected, approved, ſent and ſetled to be Parſons and Vicars in Pariſh Churches? who you know are neither elected nor ordained by that Church over whom they are ſet. Remove this beam out of your own eye, before you ſee the mote in you brothers.</p>
                  <p>Well, but what was the errour? this, that the Pariſh contented it ſelf with a Parſon and Vicar, for a Paſtour, Teacher, and Ruler; as if the Parſon and Vicar might not be all theſe; might not feed, teach and rule
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:115308:54"/>
his flock? what ſhould hinder him? for call him by what name you pleaſe, his office and duty is the ſame; and a Parſon and Vicar is bound as much to feed, teach and guide his flock, as is your Paſtour, Teacher and Ruler; and muſt anſwer the neglect of it as well as they; this is to ſeek a knot in a ruſh. Be pleaſed to tranſlate Parſon by a Latine word, and you ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes finde it rendred by <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Rector Eccleſiae,</hi> and how then is the man or his name changed? and if the Latines may content themſelves to be under the <hi>Paſtor</hi> or <hi>Rector,</hi> I ſee no reaſon but the Engliſh may as well be content with their Parſon.

                     <hi>1.</hi> The degeneration was, when it climbed up to be a Provincial Church.</head>
                  <p>But what if this prove no Degeneration at all? For every thing is ſaid to degenerate when it is changrd to the worſe, whereas this change (if there were any, which I ſhall not eaſily grant you) was into the better; for by this the Church was better ordered and governed than it could be without it. At firſt the Church was ſo ſmall, that an upper roome was able to containe it; it enlarged in Cities, then in Countries, after into whole Provinces. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned it muſt be, when ſmall or great; and governed it was by the Apoſtles while they lived, and by thoſe whom they appointed. Theſe Governours by them placed, were ſeated in chief Cities, as at <hi>Jeruſalem, Antioch, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> And becauſe they had the Provinces allotted to them, the Churches were called Provincial. This I have ſhewed before clearly in <hi>Titus,</hi> who was ſet over <hi>Crete.</hi> But it may be ſaid the Provinces were not then converted, how then could ſuch Governours be ſet over them? This is not material. For as the Apoſtles might rightly be called the Governours of the whole world (becauſe Chriſt committed all Nations to their charge) though at firſt a ſmall Congregation did obey them actually: So that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour that was placad in any Metropolis or chief City by them, though actually he had in his communion and ſubjection ſome few, yet he had in Charge, the converſion of the whole Countrey; and being converted, they were under his government, and he was called their Metropolitane. That you ſtartle not at the word, I have told you before, that it was very ancient, to be found in the Apoſtolical Canons, in the Nicene, Antiochian,<note place="margin">Conc. Epheſ. edictum poſt adventum epiſc. Cypri.</note> and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſine Councils, the words of this laſt Council being theſe, It ſeemeth good to this ſacred and Oecumenical Council to reſerve unto every Province un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and undiminiſhed the rights which they have had <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from the firſt beginning, every Metropolitan having liberty according to the old cuſtome to take the copy of our Acts for his ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>I know well what you will caſt in my teeth, that this was the wiſdome of the fleſh, and the wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity with God. But firſt conſider that it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a cuſtome of old, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a cuſtome from the beginning; and the period of that may be for what we know to the contrary ſet in the Apoſtles. Secondly, I deny it abſolutely to be the wiſdome of the fleſh. For there is fleſh that is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115308:57"/>
and the wiſdome of that fleſh is enmity with God; for ambition that is a corrupt quality reſiding in it, will prompt it to deſire honour; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe to aime at wealth; ſelfe-love to promote and ſerve its luſts. But there is fleſh again that is regenerate and borne anew, which is contented to be guided by Gods Spirit inſtructing a man to obey Gods will revealed in his Word, and this is not enmity with God. I ſhall never think that Grace outs any man of his reaſon; it may perfect, heighten, enlighten it, but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en or dimme it, it can never do. Whatſoever therefore a man ſhall do by the light of reaſon raiſed by Grace to this pitch, I ſhall not call it the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the fleſh, nor be perſwaded it is enmity againſt God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Fathers of the Church were men very eminent for the graces and gifts of the Spirit, men who were ſignal for illuminated reaſon: Even reaſon taught them that there muſt needs be confuſion where there was no order; where there was equality, there could be no order, and therefore in an equality it was not poſſible the Church ſhould continue. They ſaw that there was in one family but one Maſter; in one Army but one General; in one ſhip but one Pilot; in one Bee-hive but one King; reaſon taught them that there muſt be, and experience that there was <hi>ſub &amp; ſupra</hi> in all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, and therefore that it muſt be ſo in the Societies of Gods people. Thus farre nature. But Reaſon improved by Grace taught them again, that God would not be ſerved according to mans inventions, and therefore they muſt look, that though Reaſon ſuggeſted this or that, yet nothing muſt be done, that was contrary to Gods will revealed in his Word. They here then caſt about to finde, if they could, any thing contrary to what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dictated; now this appeared not, but rather the contrary; for they found it written, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order, all to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and that this was a precept for the regulating of the Church. And upon it, it was eſtabliſhed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from the beginning to this day, that in all Provinces there ſhould be one chief Biſhop, which from the mother City was called a Metropolitan, to whom all the other Biſhops ſhould be ſubject, and who to him ſhould be accomptable for what was done through the whole Province. This then was not the wiſdome of the fleſh, but the wiſdome of God, who would have all things done in order. If any man did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, teach other things than he taught, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, teach any new things, and not according to the Analogy or rule of faith, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For Diſcipline is the preſervation and hedge of Doctrine; and Diſcipline can never be well adminiſtred among them that have an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual power. I pray tell me, what was the reaſon that moved his Highneſſe the Lord Protector to take upon him the government of this Common-wealth? was it not becauſe he foreſaw that all would come to ruine in a parity of Governours? which was the aime of thoſe who fancied a fifth Monarchy. This is the very reaſon that he himſelf aſſignes. And ſay what you will to the contrary, this is and will be the fate of the Church, except in one Province there be one chief. Could I give no other inſtances of it,

To him then lay Appeales. And yet his power was not abſolute and arbitrary, for he was to execute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Synods onely, and to judge according to the Canons.

Austin</hi> was alſo made the Suffragan to <hi>Valerius</hi> in <hi>Hippo;</hi> and afterward <hi>Austin</hi> himſelf took for his Coadjutor <hi>Eradius.</hi> Thus you may ſee a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor was allowed, but ſuch a one as ſhould be onely a Presbyter, while the Biſhop lived; and therefore long after the time of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſociated another Biſhop, as a Coadjutor to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> he confeſſed it to be a thing forbidden by the Canons, and worthy reprehenſion, but that upon his importunity, of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favour, he had yielded ſo much unto him, that he might have ſuch a Coadjutor, whom with the advice of his brethren he might appoint to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him when he ſhould dye. Now if you do aime at theſe, there could be no great errour in the inſtitution, if the Biſhop either when he was <hi>in remotis agendis</hi> as the Lawyers ſpeak, or diſabled by infirmity or age, he made choice of ſome worthy perſon to be his Coadjutor; no otherwiſe then the High Prieſts among the Jewes did of their <hi>Saganim.</hi> For I read not of any expreſſe text of holy writ, that could or did warrant them to do it.</p>

A Commiſſion to this purpoſe I finde given by <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> after Earle of <hi>Eſſex;</hi> that great inſtrument of expulſion of the Popes power out of <hi>England:</hi> by which authority he viſited all the Abbies and Monaſteries of the Land, and finding in them foul enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, opened them in Parliament the next year, in which he ſate with the title of Vicegerent, or <hi>Cuſtos ſpiritualitatum;</hi> this power was not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a Vicar General.

                  <p>SIr, that affection which I have alwayes borne you as a friend, and that duty which I owe you as a Chriſtian, moves me in plain words to tell you, that the indulgence you bear to the Combinational Church, hath in this Paragraph tranſported you beyond the bounds of moderation and truth. For to omit your common Sophiſme, <hi>petitio principii,</hi> which is the fouleſt in all Logick; that there was at firſt a Combinational Church, and that this did precede a National; which is as if you ſhould ſay, the parts are before the whole, when the contraty in nature hath hitherto been received for truth, that <hi>omne totum ſive univerſale ſive integrale eſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us partibus.</hi> But to omit this, you over-load your aſſertion with many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Epithets, and thoſe ſometimes unapt; whereas attributes are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, and where they are not decently affixed, they become our ſpeech no more, than a fair gold lace doth a coarſe garment, or a rich jewel faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a ſtraw hat.

Laſtly, you ſay they were brought in by a Jewiſh imitation, which if granted, it would not at all help your cauſe; as I will after make appear. Theſe are your undertakings in this Section, and I ſhall not need to analyſe it, as I have done before; becauſe you have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiz'd it to my hand, for which I thank you. The firſt thing then I ſhall prove unto you, is that there is ſuch a thing as a National Church, and that it was before your Combinational, ſo that it cannot be true which you affirme; that the fourth degree of the Combinational Churches defection, was its notably naughty enlarging it ſelf into a National Church.</p>

Thus it was foretold, and that what was foretold might accordingly be fulfilled, our Saviour gave his diſciples a Commiſſion in theſe general words, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> Matthew 28.19.

                  <p>I can never ſufficiently wonder at your words, when you call this acceſſe of all Nations a naughty enlargement.

                  <p>But a ſtronger foundation for this Truth there cannot be, than that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath laid under the ſimilitude of an Olive which had two kinds of branches, natural, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. and wild, 17.<note place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Jewes, the wild the Gentiles; the natural were broken off through unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the wild by faith graffed in. Theſe wild now being naturalized, are in the ſame condition that the Natural were before they were broken off. But the Natural branches were in the Olive totally, the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they and their children, which made the National Church of the Jewes, and therefore the wild branches muſt be ſo inſerted, they and their children alſo, which will make the National Church of the Gentiles, which is the full ſcope and intention of the Apoſtle in that chapter. Finally, the very ſame Covenant that was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.16.</note> is made with the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> As that then was extended to the whole Nation of the Jewes,<note place="margin">Lev. 26.12.</note>

Thus have I ſhewed you that ſince the whole Church <hi>quoad materiale</hi> doth conſiſt of Nations, there can be no impropriety or abſurdity in it, when we call any part thereof a National Church, or the Church of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in any one Nation. And now let us ſee what help you can have for the confirmation of this beſides Scripture out of the principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We believe in our Creed the Catholique Church, and Catholique it is called in reſpect of all ages and times, becauſe, before, under, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law it alwayes was: and ſecondly, in reſpect of perſons; for there is not any perſon of what degree, ſex, condition or age, that may not be a member of it. And thirdly, in reſpect of places, in that as formerly the Jewes, ſo now all perſons in all Nations have a capacity to be of the Church of Chriſt. Univerſality then being an attribute of the Church, it cannot be found in any one Church limited either in reſpect of time or place. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then make your Combinational Church the Catholique, or you muſt extend it farther; and if ſo, why not to a Province? and if to a Province, why not to a Nation, nay many Nations? And be it you ſhould aſſume the name of Catholique, and faſten it to every particular Combinational Church, yet particular Societies of Chriſtians can lay no farther claime to it than they can demonſtrate themſelves to belong to that Church that hath a true and a juſt title to it; which no particular Church can do, but by proving that it holds the common faith once delivered to the Saints with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heretical innovation,<note place="margin">Ameſ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>31.</hi> Sect. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> or ſchiſmatical violation of the Unity and Peace of the Chriſtian world. This being the way for particular Churches to demonſtrate themſelves to be Catholique, neceſſary it is that they be united at leaſt to thoſe Congregations of that Nation; whence we may infer that there muſt needs be a National Church, which alſo that muſt do, and ſhew clearly that it maintaines whole and undefiled the foundations of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be acknowledged to be Catholique.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:115308:62"/>2. That which makes men miſtake in this point, is, that they make the Church to be <hi>ſpecies ſpecialiſſima,</hi> whereas it is <hi>Locale genus,</hi> ſuch are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther collective words, <hi>exercitus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Keckerm. ſyſt. in fin. c. de gen.</note>

Say then, that this word Church is <hi>totum univerſale,</hi> then it muſt have <hi>partes ſubjectivas</hi> under it, and ſo it hath; for <hi>Eccleſia Britanica, Belgica, Genevenſis, Germanica, Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, &amp;c.</hi> are as it were ſo many Species, where you may finde ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches that do equally participate of the nature of the Genus, and under them ſo many Individuums as there be particular Congregations in any of theſe Nations. Neither doth <hi>Ameſius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ameſ. Loc. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tato Sect. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> who affirmes the Church to be a <hi>Species ſpecialiſſima,</hi> give any teaſon for it, but that <hi>nullas habet ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es propriè dictas,</hi> which is illogical; for I told you, that it was <hi>Genus ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logum;</hi> and will any Logician expect <hi>ſpecies propriè dictas?</hi> it is ſufficient for ſuch a genus to have <hi>ſpecies impropriè dictas,</hi> by compariſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance onely to a true Genus; and ſuch the Church hath as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore there may be a National Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that which is capable of the definition of the Church, may be called a Church. But a National Church is capable of the definition of a Church; therefore there may be a National Church. The major is out of queſtion, and needs no proof. The minor I make good by ſetting down, and applying the definition of the Church to it. <hi>Ameſius.</hi>

                     <hi>Eccleſia eſt caetus hominum vocatorum.</hi> But his definition though it would ſerve my turn is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle too ſhort. <hi>Iunius</hi> hath more fully expreſſed it. <hi>Eccleſia eſt caetus eorum quos Deus evocat è natura &amp; modulo naturali ipſorum per gratiam in dignitatem filiorum Dei ad ipſius gloriam.

                  <p>Firſt, to the Church in common, which is, <hi>Eccleſia eſt caetus eorum quos Deus gratuita vocatione, ad gratiae ſuae &amp; gloriae communionem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocat,</hi> Matth. 11.29.</p>

                  <p>All which definitions, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Trelcatius,</hi> are full and artificial; for <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is by all put in the predicament of relation, and all relations are defined <hi>mentione ſubjecti, relati, correlati, fundamenti,</hi>

takes in Angels alſo. The <hi>Formale</hi> or foundation of this Relation, is that gracious call that God gives; and the end is, that they being adopted for his children, may communicate in his worſhip, grace and glory.</p>
                  <p>Now what one word is there in any one or all theſe definitions which are not as well applicable to a National Church,<note place="margin">Deut. 5.22. Exod. 16.1.</note> as a Combinational? Is this <hi>caetus, kahal,</hi> an Aſſembly, a <hi>Gnedah,</hi> a Congregation? that is much more. Doth this conſiſt of men? There are more in that. Have thoſe in this a Call, a gracious call given them by God? ſo have the other. Are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted and brought into the ſtate of ſonnes? ſo are they too. <hi>I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and brought up children:</hi> Are theſe called to worſhip God, to be partakers of grace and glory?<note place="margin">Iſa. 1.2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I know your exception lies againſt the formal cauſe; for that gracious call of God will not ſatisfie you, which hath contented all other judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines before you: But you aſſigne another, <hi>viz.</hi> a Church-Covenant, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying that none can be truly members of Chriſts Church, but who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined and joyned themſelves together in this League of Church-fellowſhip. This ſay you, is the chief eſſential part of a Church, and the true formality of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ameſius</hi> teacheth us truly, that <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is <hi>à Deo inſtituta.</hi> If ſo, let it be ſhewn where God inſtituted his Church under this condition; produce the precept, bring forth the command for it, or elſe you ſhall never perſwade me that this Inſtitution is from God. Nay, I ſhall yet deſcend lower, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to me the practice of it, or the patterne for it, either in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles age, or any age after it, till you aroſe, and you ſhall carry the cauſe. I know that the wiſeſt among you is not able to ſhew me one example for it in all antiquity.</p>
                  <p>We cannot therefore chooſe but ſet upon it the character of <hi>Ionah</hi>'s gourd, that is, <hi>filia noctis,</hi> a daughter of a nights growth, it ſprung up ſo lately. The fartheſt the pedegree can reach, is either to the Montaniſts, Novatians, or Donatiſts, thoſe children of Separation; and yet when alls done it doth but reſemble them neither, ſince I read not that they and their parties were ever bandied together by a ſolemne Covenant. They could think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Church, and indeed the ſole Church without this formality. They had their Biſhops under whoſe juriſdiction all the ſeveral Congregations of their profeſſion were. And therefore I ſhall again repeat my words, that no pattern for this in any age can be found; and I adde to it, no not among Hereticks and Schiſmaticks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we ſhall give a poor accompt of former Churches and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if this Covenant-invention ſhould be of ſuch concernment to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: when it is not eaſie, nor as I beleeve, poſſible to finde a Church anciently ſo bound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:115308:63"/>Farther, yet this ſeems to me altogether uſeleſſe and ſuperfluous, and that in two reſpects. Firſt, it ſeems uſeleſſe to them who are ſo bound; for theſe new ſmall bodies are ſo looſly tyed together by theſe ſorry withs of mans invention, that they quickly upon humour, anger and heady animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities fall aſunder, and break into ſeveral fractions and ſubdiviſions; ſo that they by reciting a certain forme of words, ſeem to meet as pieces of wood finely glued together, which a little ſpittle or wet diſſolves. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is uſeleſſe to them who are bound already by a higher and more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Covenant; for this is as it were to binde a man with wiſps of ſtraw, that is already bound with chains of gold. For every true and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Chriſtian knows and owns himſelf to have upon his conſcience, farre more ſtrict and indiſſoluble ties, not onely of nature and creation, but of the Law and word of God: yea, and of Chriſtian Covenant and Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by his Baptiſmal vow, beſides that bond of the other Sacrament, that I ſpeak not of his vowes renewed by often promiſes in his prayers, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant promiſes: All which binds the conſciences of all good Chriſtians to all duties of piety and charity according to the relations wherein they ſtand to God and man, farre more firmly than any external profeſſion in a Church way can do. An external I ſay; for ſo it is, and being meerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, it cannot <hi>ingredi rei eſſentiam,</hi> make any man formally a Church member; that which doth this is the call of God, and not the profeſſion of man. And now having removed this rub out of my way, I ſhall go on to give you a fourth argument for a National Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That to whom the proper, eſſential and inſeparable notes of the Church belong is a Church; but to a National Church theſe notes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; therefore a National Church is a Church. The <hi>major</hi> is certain, for it is <hi>nota proprii;</hi> the <hi>minor</hi> I eaſily prove.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115308:64"/>
Churches, and thoſe moſt eminent at firſt; and if it appear that thoſe were National, we may from hence eaſily inferre, that the conſtitution of a Church may be National. It is in all Church Hiſtories moſt evident, that as ſoon as the Goſpel was firſt planted, it ſpread from great Cities into the Neighbour Territories and adjacent Countries; which Chriſtians ſo converted, though they exerciſed the acts of Religion in particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, yet ſtill continued in a fraternal ſubjection, and filial ſubmiſſion to that Biſhop and Presbytery which reſided in the Mother City: It is a foule miſtake for men to conceive of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyra, &amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Corinth, Antioch, Jeruſalem, Rome, &amp;c.</hi> as confined to that City; whereas he who is acquainted with Hiſtories profane and ſacred, muſt know that under theſe Cities were principalities, and ſo the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Church was extended to all Chriſtians in that Territory. Which to deny, is to ſleight all Records, and to preferre his own ſingle imagination before all antiquity; <hi>Titus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Crete</hi> an Iſland; <hi>Timothy</hi> of <hi>Epheſus</hi> a Province; <hi>Polycarp</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> a Territory; and what is true of theſe, is as true of all the reſt; whence we may conclude, that a Church may be National; for if juriſdiction of one Biſhop may extend over ſo great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they were, being then the chief of the world; why not then to a Province? why not to a Nation? eſpecially ſince by this way, mutual peace, truth and good order is beſt preſerved.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration cauſed the firſt ſmall company of believers, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed from a Church in one family, to a Church in many Congregations, that could not meet together in one place, yet as branches to continue ſtill united to the root Chriſt Jeſus; and alſo to the main body and bulk of the Church by union to that part whence they deſcended, and to which they related. For reaſon taught them that they ſhould be weaker, and expoſed to more danger, if they ſhould be diſunited and rent from the body, and quickly wither, as boughs ſeparated from the ſtock. I need not minde you of that old Apologue of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> that the head and feet quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtarved and windred away, when they would not hear of any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the belly.</p>
                  <p>He that would be magnified for <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> or <hi>magnus, Simon</hi> the great, and wiſe for his invention of rarities and Paradoxes in any art or ſcience, ought to furniſh himſelf not with popular and ſpecious, but with ſolid and ſound arguments, if he intend to winne prudent and ſober men to be of his judgment: for <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; wiſe men will not be catch't with thoſe ſophiſms, with which it is eaſie to take the multitude. After the flood, there were but eight perſons in the world; they lived together in a family for ſome time, and <hi>Noah</hi> as a Prince ruled them. But they quickly encreaſed, ſpread, multiplyed, grew into thoſe Nations that now live, and being diſperſed over the earth, they yet joyned in ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, and for their mutual preſervation, thought it fit to be governed that way that we now behold. Suppoſe now ſome great and wiſe <hi>Magus,</hi> ſhould in theſe words charme and bewitch the people, <hi>Non ſic fuit ab initio,</hi> in <hi>Noahs</hi> dayes the ordering of the world was not as we ſee it now; there
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115308:64"/>
were then no mighty Monarchs, no ſurly Lords, no Judges, no Magiſtrates. Who then ſpoke of National ſocieties or civil confederations? Oh 'twas a brave world then, when the government was domeſtical; a golden age when no man ruled beyond his own doors, but every one was a King at home. Could we but contrive a way, and live to ſee it ſo in our dayes, 'twould be no queſtion a brave world again.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Adam</hi> dugge and <hi>Eve</hi> ſpan, who was then a Gentleman?</p>
                  <p>The like argument to this is uſed by thoſe of the Combination. At <hi>Rome</hi> they finde a houſeful of Chriſtians; at <hi>Corinth</hi> another handful met together in the houſe of <hi>Cloe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 16.5. 1 Cor. 16.29. 1 Cor. 1.11.</note> In <hi>Aſia</hi> there is mention made of ſingle Churches. (but by the way, that theſe were bourd together by a Church Covenant, and a ſeparate, and Independent Congregation, that had no relation to the Presbytery in thoſe Cities, that is not mentioned, not a word of that) Then there were no National Churches; this was afterwards brought in by lordly Prelates: Oh if we might but ſee the Church reſtored again, and all things done according to the pattern in the Mount, then it would be a glorious Church, Gods people, precious people, all Kings, Prieſts and Prophets within their own doors. You then of the people, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the pooreſt Plow-man, and ignoranteſt Mechanick ſhould recover his right, <hi>primo queſtu,</hi> and be ſubject to no other Paſtours and Elders then were of your own chooſing, nor to them no longer then pleaſed you. Now is not this kind of arguing very plauſible in the peoples ears? Oh how they will hugge themſelves, when they ſhall finde themſelves to become ſome body? Let us, ſay they, but joyne our ſelves in this Combination, and then God knows what goodly great things we may come to be; we may come to be Paſtours to feed; we may come to be Elders to rule the flock; we may come to be Deacons and carry the bag: and if we ſail of theſe our hopes, yet however we have voices in the Election of Church Officers, and the higheſt of them all muſt depend upon us. This is that which tickleth the multitude to reduce the Church to the houſe of <hi>Cloe,</hi> as thoſe Sophiſts would do the world to the Ark of <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now one of theſe is as abſurd as the other; as contrary to reaſon to bring back the Church to particular houſes and Combinations, as it is all the ſocieties of men to domeſtical government. Shall an example or two, (which yet comes not home neither) be pleaded againſt a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to the contrary? when we can inſtance in Presbyteries conſtituted by the Apoſtles in chief Cities, which were heads of whole Provinces; ſhall we plead that two or three houſes were patterns in the Mount? This is ſo childiſh a fancy, ſo weak and unreaſonable an imagination, as if they would reduce themſelves to their infants Coats, now they are grown men; or think they are bound to wear a leathern girdle, becauſe Saint <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt did ſo.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, we dare appeal to the conſciences of any of theſe bodying Chriſtians (whom charity may preſume to be godly and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious)<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Gauden.</hi>

whether they finde in Scripture, or have juſt cauſe to think that the bleſſed Apoſtles ever conſtituted ſuch ſmall bodies of Covenanting Churches, when there were great numbers, and many Congregations of Chriſtians in any City, Province, or Country, ſo as each one ſhould be thought abſolute, independent, and no way ſubordinate to another? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever the Apoſtles required of thoſe leſſer handfuls, thoſe peti-toes and fingers of the body (which might and did Convene in <hi>Cloes</hi> houſe) any ſuch explicite forms and Covenants, beſides thoſe holy bonds, which by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving and profeſſing of the faith by Baptiſme and Euchariſtical commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were upon them? Or whether the bleſſed Apoſtles would have que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or denyed them to be true Chriſtians, and in a true Church, or have ſeparated from them, or caſt them off as not engrafted in Chriſt, or growing up in him, who without any ſuch bodying in ſmall parcels had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the due uſe of the Word, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Miniſtry? who endeavoured to lead a holy life themſelves, and ſought by all means which charity, order, or authority allowed them to repreſſe the contrary in others. The wiſdome of theſe firſt planters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was ſo great, their charity ſo warme, their perſwaſions to unity ſo earneſt; the Character they ſet upon thoſe who ſeparate, ſo black, that it cannot be beleeved that ever they would admit of a rent in that body, which was inſtructed by one head, enlived by one ſpirit, formed by one faith, and quickned by one and the ſame hope.

                  <p>COncerning which I have divers things to reply. Firſt, if we muſt be accuſed for this apiſh imitation of the Jews, yet we are not the only Apes, ſince you for this are no leſſe guilty than our ſelves; and then you know, <hi>qui alterum incuſat probri, ipſum ſe tueri oportet.</hi> For do you not imitate the Jewiſh Sanedrim in your Elderſhips? why is it elſe that from it moſt of your party fetch their defence? why from it do they borrow their light to expound <hi>dic Eccleſiae?</hi> Again, that the Scripture is not to be read, except expounded, is your common tenet; we preſſe you for a precept for this, and none you do, nor none you can bring; only you produce the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe,<note place="margin">Nehem. 8.8.</note>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115308:65"/>
Your letter bears date the 22 day of the eighth moneth, which is you know to ſpeak the language of the old Jew.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ask how ever you can make good that, in moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which you alledge; that the Chriſtians took their pattern from the Jewes after they were formed into a National Church, and were put under the Ceremonial Law. If in theſe they imitated any, I may as eaſily ſay that they took their pattern from the Patriarchs for theſe; before the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law were impoſed, as you can reflect upon the Nation of the Jews. For the Patriarchs had their feaſts, their places whether to bring their offerings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20. &amp; 13.18. &amp; 28.22. &amp; 33.20.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.2. Exod. 5.1.</note> They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a high Prieſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. They paid tyths, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.20. &amp; 28.22. Four then of theſe five frivolous traditions, as you call them, were in uſe before the Jews were a ſetled Nation, and to thoſe old and firſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God the Primitive Church might have an eye when they admitted theſe uſages, as well as to their poſterity. And the Jew ſtrictly ſo taken need be caſt in our teeth no more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Suppoſe it were granted that theſe cuſtomes were brought in by a Jewiſh imitation, yet it will not hence follow that they are ere the worſe, or are therefore to be rejected. The objection is old,<note place="margin">Hook. Eccl. pol. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Sect. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> and to it Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> hath given a ſatisfactory anſwer. For the Jewiſh Ordinances were of two ſorts, poſitive, or moral. The moral were never to be aboliſhed; the poſitive again were ſuch which were not neceſſary for ever to be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or ſuch as were left indifferent to be kept or not. Sacrifice and circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were of the firſt kind, and muſt neceſſarily be removed, which was done in their due time; in theſe the Chriſtian Gentiles, no not at firſt after the decree, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. muſt not imitate the Jews. But for the ſecond ſort, ſuch which were of an indifferent nature to be kept or not to be kept, (of which kinde I will by and by produce many inſtances,) the Gentile Chriſtians were no way blameable, if they conformed themſelves to the Jewiſh cuſtome;<note place="margin">Leo Serm. ſept. de jejun. menſis ſeptim.</note> which gave <hi>Leo</hi> occaſion thus to begin his Sermon. <hi>Apostolica inſtitutio, dilectiſſimi, quae Jeſum Chriſtum Dominum ad hoc veniſſe in hunc mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum noverat, ut legem non ſolveret, ſed impleret, ita veteris Teſtamenti decreta diſtinxit, ut quaedam ex iis, ſicut erant condita, Evangelicae eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioni profutura decerperet, &amp; quae dudum fuerant conſuetudinis Judaicae, fierent obſervantiae Chriſtianae.</hi> And this very faſt of the ſeventh month then kept, may ſerve for one inſtance.

The ſecond were called <hi>Ger-ſahagnar Proſelytae portae,</hi> a Proſelyte or ſtranger within thy gates, <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.21. ſuch was <hi>Naaman</hi> the Eunuch, &amp;c. He was not circumciſed, nor bound to obſerve all the Moſaical Rites. Only it was an opinion conſtantly received among the Jewes, that God delivered unto the ſonnes of <hi>Noah</hi> ſeven precepts,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115308:66"/>
which went under the name of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſeven Commandements. 1. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhment for Malefactours. 2. Bleſſing and calling on the Name of God, under which was contained the keeping of the Sabbath. 3. Diſclaiming Idolatry. 4. Uncovering of ones nakedneſſe, or all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean knowledge in the fleſh. 5. Shedding of blood. 6. Robbery and rapine. 7. Not to eat of any living creature whereof the blood was not let out. Foure of theſe Commands the Gentiles were apt to obſerve of their own accord, nature leading them thereunto; but the other three, the Apoſtles thought good to impoſe upon them; <hi>viz,</hi> the third, the fourth, and the ſeventh, to give content to the Jewes, that the Gentiles being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable unto them in the obſervation of theſe Laws of <hi>Noah,</hi> they might cleave the better together. Dare any man now ſay the Apoſtles were too blame, to bring the Gentiles to a Jewiſh imitation? what ſhould I tell you, that all the Eaſt Church, and we in this Iſland did celebrate the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, upon what day of the week ſoever it fell, untill <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time? and was not this a Jewiſh imitation? for which indeed Pope <hi>Victor</hi> condemned &amp; excommunicated the Eaſtern Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and all the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; but he himſelf for this preſumption and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is condemned and cenſured by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> That the Chriſtians at firſt kept the Jewiſh Sabbath, as well as the Lords day: That the Weſt Church celebrated the Euchariſt in unleavened bread, is a known truth to all that are acquainted with antiquity; and what were theſe but Jewiſh Rites? and whence could they learn them, but from the Jewiſh Synagogue? and yet I never read any condemnation of the Primitive Church for theſe.

                        </gap>pae</hi> but from the Jewes? From hence then two concluſions there are, which may be evidently drawn. The one, that whatſoever poſitive Laws the Apoſtles or their Succeſſours did bring in, between the Churches of Jewes and Gentiles, it was in thoſe things onely which might either ceaſe or continue a ſhorter or a longer time, as occaſion did moſt require: The other, that things indifferent though brought in by the pattern of the Jewiſh Synagogue, yet are not to be condemned and caſt out upon this ground, becauſe they are of a Jewiſh imitation.</p>

This was it I had to return to your two Generals; now I come to your five degrees, in which this imitation lies, and will conſider them in the ſame method you propoſe them. You ſay</p>

                     <p>WHich words I muſt profeſſe I clearly underſtand not in all points; for what is it you mean by theſe fifty yearly Feſtivals? are they all the Sundayes of the year? if that, we own them, &amp; that not upon any Jewiſh imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                     <p>As for your term Curſed-Maſſe, I hope you intend not the day of our Saviours Nativity, when for the glad tydings the Angels joyned in a Quire, and ſang an Athemne in the fields of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Could I conceive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to black that day with that accurſed word, I ſhould grow impatient, and return, The Lord rebuke thee.

                     <p>I know yet that theſe words Chriſtmas and Candlemas often offend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but then you muſt lay the blame (if there be any) on thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.

Of which the Sacrament being a ſigne and a ſeal, they there met together to be partakers of it. This is all, that to a good intelligent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian the Maſſe can import; and if any be other minded, they may be eaſily informed, and then I ſee not what ſcandal can be taken at the name of Chriſt-Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>And I am ſure much leſſe at the Feaſt; For if ever God beſtowed a bleſſing upon the world, it was his Sonne, and the fleſh of the Sonne of God, is the Channel in which it flows to us: This fleſh he took at his birth; his birth day then is worth remembrance; that then we performe <hi>opus diei in die ſuo:</hi> and the <hi>opus diei</hi> is that we be glad and rejoyce in it. Never fear, there is no Judaiſme in it; then I am certain in this you cannot imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; for they are enemies to his name, enemies to his birth, enemies to his day; they if they could would expunge his memory out of the hearts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, out of the Calender; joyne not with this perverſe and obſtinate gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I ſhall ſet before you a more noble example to imitate, the firſt Martyrs, the firſt Confeſſours, the firſt Fathers of the Church: for theſe worthies kept this day; to them it was a holy, no working day; on that day they did feaſt, not ſcorn and revile.</p>

Sermon of <hi>Cyprian</hi> (and he lived divers years before the Nicene Council) which he preached upon the day,<note place="margin">Cypr.

Other men may follow what new lights they pleaſe, but I ſhall deſire to be guided by theſe old Lamps in this practiſe of praiſe and thankfulneſſe. I know there is no ſuperſtition,, no imitation of Judaiſme in it. It is a Chriſtian, a laudable, a pious, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable duty, and 'tis no feare of a ſhadow ſhall drive me from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And ſo having accompted for this particular Feſtival, I come to anſwer for our Church holy-dayes in general; Chriſt is both the Authour and Finiſher of our Redemption, which work before it could be conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the purchaſe muſt be made, applyed, proclaimed. That he might be apt to lay down the price, he muſt be made man, conceived of the Holy Ghoſt, born of a woman a Virgin, born under the Law, of which he gave an evidence when he was circumciſed the eighth day, preſented in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at his Mothers purification, and baptized by <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan.</hi> This ſhewed that he took upon him the form of a ſervant, and humbled himſelf. But he thought himſelf not low enough, till he humbled himſelf to the death, even that bloody, ſhameful, painful, accurſed death of the Croſſe, upon which he was crucified, upon which he dyed, and was afterward buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. By all this the purchaſe was fully made, and the ranſome fully paid, <hi>Conſummatum eſt.</hi> But it muſt be applyed alſo, and conveyed to us, or we are nere the better. To effect this, he roſe again for our juſtification, he aſcended into heaven to make interceſſion, and prepare a place for us, he ſent down his Spirit to make all ſure. And that all this might be made known, publiſhed and proclaimed, he gave ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome to be Evangeliſts; theſe to write the whole ſtory, and thoſe to atteſt it, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, and apply it in their Epiſtles.</p>
                     <p>Now this is the original of our Feſtivals, there being not one retained in our Church, which is not to the honour of Chriſt, to the memory of ſome Evangeliſt or Apoſtle. The wiſdome of the Church was ſuch, that ſhe would not have ſo great benefits forgotten, nor the purchaſe, nor the application, nor the proclamation. Into the Creed they are all put, but words are like wind, they may quickly paſſe away. The wiſe founders therefore of our Church, and firſt planters of Religion, ſet out a day for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Article, that in the time to come when the children ſhall ask their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, What meaneth theſe dayes, theſe Feſtivals? they ſhould anſwer and ſay, This day Chriſt was conceived, this day he was born, this day he was circumciſed, this day his Mother was purified, this day he was baptized, this day he was crucified; and ſo laid down a ranſome for us, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115308:68"/>
us that were all loſt. And that we might know, that what he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook, he went through, and hath conveyed unto us; this day he aroſe from the grave, this day he aſcended to heaven, this day he ſent down his holy Spirit upon the Apoſtles, who have proclaimed and publiſhed ſo much to the world, and with their blood ſealed the teſtimony to be true. All this was the work of the whole Trinity; for the Father he gave the Sonne, he was given, and the Holy Ghoſt filled him full of grace for this work; And that ſo great benefits might never ſlip out of our minds, theſe dayes are ſet apart for commemoration, for praiſe, for thanksgiving, for imitation. Men may feed themſelves with fancies if they pleaſe, but it may be well fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that when the Feſtival and ſolemnities for the birth, life, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, aſcenſion of Chriſt, the miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Leſſons and Sermons upon them, with the Creed alſo, ſhall be turned out of the Church, 'twill not be in the power of weekly Sermons on ſome head of Religion to keep up the knowledge of Chriſt in mens hearts. A thing it ſeems obſerved by the Caſuiſts, who uſe to make the number of thoſe things that are <hi>neceſſario credenda,</hi> no more then the Feſtivals of Chriſt make known to men; and how ſure a way this is, to inſtill theſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary principles into the heads of the eaſieſt capacity, give me leave to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you upon my own experience. For when all I could ſay, would not teach the Article, the mention of the day, and inculcating why the day was to be kept, did with much eaſe and facility do it: I can never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſufficiently admire the wiſdome of the Church in the inſtitution of theſe Feſtivals.</p>
                     <p>And yet had this been an inſtitution of the Church,<note place="margin">Vide ſis Zanch. in expoſ. praecep. quarti. de die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus feſtis. <hi>Theſ. 1.2, 3.</hi>
                        </note> after ſhe ceaſed to be a Virgin, I ſhould have ſuſpected it. But when I finde a Record for the Feſtivals, that concern our Saviour in the beſt times, and that theſe were obſerved as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſemper, ubique, ab omnibus,</hi> this ſo far ſways with me, that I dare not aſſent to aboliſh them.</p>
                     <p>It is with dayes, as it is with men. They are <hi>pares in eſſe naturae.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccluſ. 33.</note> All equally from the ground, the firſt man an earthen veſſel, and the beſt ſince but ſherds of the old pot. But <hi>in eſſe morali,</hi> an imparity there is; ſome are veſſels to honour, ſome to diſhonour. The compariſon will hold in times, and ſeaſons; the periodick motion of the Sunne gives being to them all; yet are they not all of equal eſteem. For ſome are made holy, ſome common; theſe put among the dayes to number; thoſe raiſed and made high dayes, and ſet above their fellows to a holy purpoſe. Which yet was not done by chance, as it falls out in the advancement of men; but it was <hi>propter opus p ivilegiatum, quod Deus in eo fecit;</hi> ſome extraordinary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial work that God did upon that day: this is the <hi>formale diei,</hi> that gives it being and preheminence above another. This God would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred; for this work he would be thanked and praiſed, and to that end he will have ſome eſpecial time ſet apart.</p>
                     <p>Neither of this is there any doubt, when the Authour and Inſtitutor is God. But man, ſay ſome, may not uſurp upon God, and ſet apart any day of the ſix appointed for labour to a holy uſe, and thus much you inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115308:69"/>
when you call theſe holy working dayes. But of how little ſtrength this is, will hence appear. To work upon the ſix dayes the Jews were bound, no leſſe then we are; and yet even then, when they were to do all things according to the pattern in the Mount, they never thought they ſhould tranſgreſſe Gods holy Command, though without any expreſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſet out ſome dayes to remember his mercies, and bleſſe his Name. Upon no other ground did <hi>Mordecai</hi> inſtitute the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained it to be obſerved in their generations for ever: An anniverſary Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival it was to be,<note place="margin">Eſth. 9.21, 22. 1 Maccab. 7.49. &amp; 4.54. John 10.22.</note> and yet we finde no precept to warrant it. The <hi>Encenia</hi> or Feaſt of Dedication of the Temple was no other. The ordainer was <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> a Civil Magiſtrate; the obſervation required by Law, by ordinance, and the ſolemnization continued 165 years. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Authour man, and the obligation a Command; our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to obſerve it. I cannot beleeve that our good Lord, that did nothing amiſſe, would have honoured the Feaſt with his preſence, had the ordinance of man in ſuch a caſe been diſpleaſing to God. To come cloſer to the point, ſhould a man preſſe theſe ſtrait-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced men for a Command to keep the Lords day, I am ſure they could not finde it. That it was obſerved by the Apoſtles I eaſily beleeve, becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt day of the week <hi>they brake bread, they enjoyned the Collect;</hi> becauſe even then it is called <hi>dies Dominicus.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 20.7. 1 Cor. 16.2.

The new converted Proſelytes conceived they muſt keep their old Sabbath, and the ancient Feaſts as afore, when <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was in force, expecting juſtification by the obſervation of thoſe legal Ceremonies.

                     <p>To cloſe this point, this we ſay, and we colour not to ſay it, that theſe Feſtivals are dayes hallowed, conſecrated and ſet apart to the performance of holy duties.

Let not then this flower of our time ſuffer by an Oſtraciſme; nor fancy, nor imitation, nor ſuperſtition, nor will-worſhip hath ſet the mark upon it: the Jew may lie in his grave, and yet our holy-dayes live. Theſe are like the good and vertuous Ladies of our Land; few they are, and being obſerved they make us happy. Suffer them but to depart, and you will deface the ſplendour and dignity of Chriſtian Religion.

                     <p>For what is an Office, but that duty which every one is bound to do? and ſhall a man be mocked for doing his Office? The Office of him who is ſometime by us called the Prieſt, ſometime the Miniſter, ſometimes by other names (and yet all's but one and the ſame man) is to preach the word, to adminiſter the Sacraments, to make prayers and ſupplications, to give thanks, and make interceſſions for all men, which when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms he does his Office, and for the doing you ought not to condemn him. If you, or any other in your place, ſhall not conſcientiouſly performe theſe Offices, I ſhall ſay he is unworthy to carry the name of a Presbyter, which is all one as if I call'd him Prieſt.</p>
                     <p>But make the moſt and worſt you can of it. I tell you that there was to remain a Prieſt-hood under the New Teſtament, not that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but that of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi> For Chriſt was to be a Prieſt for ever after the order of <hi>Melchizedech.</hi>

Rom. 12.1.</note> And an Analogy there is betwixt theſe two. They had their bloody Sacrifices then, and we have our Sacrifices now to offer. For as Chriſt offer'd up himſelf once for all, a full and all-ſufficient Sacrifice for the ſinne of the whole world, ſo did he inſtitute and command a Memory of this Sacrifice in a Sacrament, even till his coming again. For at and in the Euchariſt, we offer up unto God three Sacrifices. One by the Miniſter only, that's the Commemorative Sacrifice of Chriſts death repreſented in bread broken, and wine poured out. Another by the Miniſter and people joyntly, and that's the Sacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving, for all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Graces we receive by the blood of Chriſt. The third by ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man for himſelf only, and that's the Sacrifice of every mans body and ſoul to ſerve God in both. Then in this for ought I know to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we all agree, that though the propitiatory Sacrifice was made by Chriſt himſelf only, yet that in the Euchariſt there remains a ſacrifice of Duty, and a ſacrifice of Praife, and a ſacrifice of Commemoration. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſee no reaſon, but the name of Prieſt may be retain'd alſo, who is to do the chiefeſt work in the offering of all theſe ſacrifices.</p>

                     <p>I could forgive you the reſt, becauſe you acknowledge theſe performances to be pious; for if they had piety in them, I ſee no reaſon why you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe have cauſe to note them for corruptions.

                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Bancroft. Featly. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond. Fulke. Taylour. Hooker Prideaux. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</note> might give you occaſion to boaſt I could not. And to anſwer, was to ſay over again that which hath been ſo often ſayd by worthy and learned men, whom if you have not conſulted, you are to blame, and I wiſh you would; if you have and are not ſatisfied, I fear my labour will be loſt. However I ſhall ſet before you, what they have ſaid before me. And firſt I ſhall ſpeak to your ſtinted worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And here give me leave firſt to ask you, to what you referre this word <hi>ſtinted,</hi> whether you ſtrictly reſtrain it to the word <hi>worſhip,</hi> or to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115308:75"/>
the Spirit by which we are to worſhip. If to the firſt, I ſee you are againſt all ſet forms of worſhip; if to the laſt, that you think the Spirit is reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe ſet forms. And becauſe both are ſaid by your party, I ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to both: and to the laſt firſt.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conceiv'd forms are either premeditate, or extempore; if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate, then the Spirit is as much limited in their conceiv'd forms, as by any forme conceiv'd by the Church. But if extempore, then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only of him that makes the prayer is left at liberty; for the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is by that means as much ſtinted and bound to a ſet forme, to wit, of thoſe words the Miniſter conceivs, as if he read them out of a book. And is not the Spirit reſtrain'd when the Congregation ſhall be confined to the forme of this one mans compoſing? If this be not ſtinted worſhip, if this be not to ſtint the Spirit, I know not what it is. And I can ſee but one way to avoid it, that every one in the Congregation conceive and offer up a prayer with his own ſpirit, and not be forced and confin'd to the Miniſters ſingle dictate; this would preſerve entirely that liberty of the Spirit you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; that other will not. To this if you will not yield, as I know you will not, it lies upon you to anſwer the objection, which I never ſaw yet done.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As for ſet forms of prayer, which I conceive you principally intend by ſtinted worſhip, I ſhall next endeavour to juſtifie them upon many grounds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the old Teſtament we find ſet forms of bleſſing and thankſgiving, and prayers appointed by God himſelf. He it was that fram'd to his Prieſts the very words with which they were to bleſſe the people.<note place="margin">Numb. 6.23.24, 25, 26. Numb. 10.35.36. 2 Chron. 29.30. Exod. 15. <hi>Selden in Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Speak to Aaron and his Sonnes, ſaying in this wiſe ſhall ye bleſſe the people; The Lord bleſſe and keep thee, &amp;c.</hi> At the remove of the Arke, a forme is ſet and taught the Prieſts, <hi>exurgat Deus, diſſipentur inimici.</hi> At the Arks return a form, <hi>Return O Lord into thy reſting place. Hezekiah</hi> preſcribed to the Prieſts to ſing praiſe to the Lord with the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> the Seer. <hi>Moſes</hi> Hymn for the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is extant, and in the ſame chapter ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up and ſung by <hi>Miriam,</hi> which afterward grew a part of the Jewiſh or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Church Liturgy, for ſuch they had, being inſtituted by <hi>Ezra</hi> and the Conſiſtory. What ſhould I tell you that the 92. Pſalm is a Pſalm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ'd for the Sabbath? The 20. Pſalm to be ſung by the people when the King went forth to battaile; The 113. to the 118. the great Hallelujah; 13. whole Pſalms, or as ſome ſay, 15. <hi>viz.</hi> from 119. to 134. Songs of degrees,<note place="margin">Moller. Ameſ. Muſculut. in Pſ. <hi>21.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe upon every one of the ſteps, which were 15. betwixt the peoples court and the Temple, the Prieſts made a ſtay, and ſung one of theſe Pſalms; and the 21. Pſalm compoſed by <hi>David</hi> to be ſung by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the King when he came home with victory.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but ſay ſome this was in the infancy and minority of the Church, as children then they needed their Feſtra's; as infirm bodies, their crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but now under the Goſpel it is otherwiſe, we have more light and gifts of the Spirit than they had. True, more light we have, becauſe the Myſtery kept ſecret from the beginning of the world, is more clearly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115308:75"/>
to us, then it was to them, but that's not the queſtion; prove they ſhould, if they ſpeak to the purpoſe, that we have now more ability to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a prayer then they had, more of the Spirit of Grace and ſupplications. Men may have a high conceit of their own abilities; but I ſuppoſe no wiſe man will conceive but that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prieſts, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the <hi>Levites</hi> had as great an ability to pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> as great a meaſure of the Spirit of grace and ſupplications, as any man that now lives, and yet they uſed and preſcribed ſet forms. Their minority then was in reſpect of the object of faith, not in reſpect of the ſpirit of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe men therefore ſhew themſelves children to talke of Feſtra's, and cripples in their underſtanding to talk of crutches; ſince thoſe mens legs were far ſtronger then theirs, and their graces of the Spirit far beyond any Enthuſiaſts in theſe days. We may think of theſe forms as meanly as we pleaſe; but <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was of another judgement;<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom. <hi>1.</hi> of prayer.</note> for thus he begins one of his Homilies of prayer. For two reaſons it becomes Gods ſervants to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and bleſſe him, both for the hope we have in their prayers, and that preſerving in writing the Hymns and Oriſons they offer'd to God with fear and joy, they have deliver'd to us their treaſure, that ſo they might draw all poſterity to their zeale and imitation. Yea, but the Spirit muſt teach us to pray, it helps all our infirmities, 'tis the promiſe of God to his Church, <hi>I will poure upon them the Spirit of Grace and ſupplications.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Zach. 12.10.</note> And all this may be done in a ſet forme, as well as by any extempore prayer. True, it is the Spirit muſt teach us to pray, both for matter and forme; for we know not what to ask and muſt teach us how to pray, for we know not how to ask; zeal and fervour, and faith, and perſeverance, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, all neceſſary affections in every ſupplicant are gifts of the Spirit; and groans and ſighs proceed from the Spirit; he moves the heart firſt to ſupplicate, brings a man to ſee in what a wretched caſe he is, one that by his ſins hath pierced the Son of God &amp; therefore to deprecate &amp; ask pardon; <hi>deprecentur ipſum, implorent illius miſericordiam.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Junius in Loc. Zach.</note> But why all this may not be as well in a petitioner that prays in a ſet forme, as in him who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the Spirit, and yet utters ſo much cold and low ſtuff on a ſudden, no wiſe man can imagin.</p>
                     <p>Compare but theſe extempore raptures with the words of <hi>Moſes, David</hi> and <hi>Aſaph</hi> the Seer, with the prayers, interceſſions, Hymns and Pſalms of the Servants and Prophets, and holy men of God uttered and left upon record, and then it will be eaſie to put the difference betwixt thoſe who are truly taught by the Spirit, and thoſe who preſume to be taught. For from the one hath proceeded prayers and ſupplications, and forms of thankſgiving ſo high and admirable, that they are beyond imitation: from the other a ſhower of words ſo flat, ſo jejune, ſo confuſed, ſo unſignificant, that ſometime they paſſe all underſtanding. Will you but have patience to hear the Cenſure of <hi>Brown</hi> himſelf after his converſion,<note place="margin">Bancroft ſer. preach'd <hi>1588.</hi>
                        </note> who thus ſpeaks to his friends concerning their extempore prayers. Good God, what worſhip or prayer do you uſe! I am aſham'd to name the boldneſſe and folly of ſome, who ſcarce able to utter three words orderly, will yet take upon them to bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115308:76"/>
out a tedious, long, and ſtuttering prayer, wherein every tenth word ſhall be the repeating of O heavenly Father, O merciful Father, O dear Father, O good Lord, O merciful God, &amp;c. and all things ſo fooliſhly pack'd together, that their prayer ſeems rather the liſping and prattling of an infant that would tell a great tale could he hit of it, then the petition of a zealous devout ſoul to his God. Theſe are the words of <hi>Brown</hi> the Patriarch, and woful experience doth juſtifie him; for in many Extemporaries, the matter of the prayer is ſo indigeſted, the words ſo incongruous, the periods ſo broken and interrupted, the length ſo tedious, the Tautologies ſo many, that a mean capacity may be apt to ſay, The prayer was never dictated by the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>To break off from this; to pray by the Spirit is two ways taken. Either for prayers made by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit, and ſo they which uſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated prayers or ſet forms, may pray by the Spirit as well as others, for the Spirit aſſiſts in the premeditation and in the delivery. Or elſe to pray by the Spirit, is to pray by the immediate inſpiration of the Spirit; as the Prophets and Apoſtles ſpoke and wrote, and thus neither they who now uſe ſet forms, nor yet they who pray extempore, can be ſaid to pray; for then their prayers ſhould be of equal authority with the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaph,</hi> and other prayers ſet down and taught by divine inſpiration. And it ſeemes that wiſdome is the daughter of time; for even they in whoſe mouths there were no other prayers lawful but extempore, have now perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commended to their proſelytes the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi> and adviſed them to make uſe of thoſe ſet formes in their devotions, which I am ſure will as much ſtint the ſpirit as any Collect in the Liturgy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I leave the old Prophets, and that which occaſioned this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, and come to the Chriſtian Church. Chriſt did not onely uſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſet forme of words in prayer, but three times together uſed the ſame words.<note place="margin">Mat. 26. Luk. 11.</note> Saint <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> taught his diſciples to pray, and it cannot be conceived but it was in a ſet forme, for two reaſons. For had he ſaid to them, the Spirit ſhall teach you, then he had not taught them, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Secondly, a forme ſure it was that the diſciples came to be taught to pray, <hi>as John taught his diſciples,</hi> and upon it Chriſt preſcribed them a forme; <hi>When you pray, ſay,</hi> In <hi>Matthew</hi> indeed it is, <hi>When you pray, ſay thus,</hi> but in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> where the forme is preſcribed, ſay <hi>This, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeemes he meant it not onely as a patterne, but as a forme it ſelf (as the ſtandard-buſhel is not onely a meaſure of all buſhels, but may it ſelf be uſed) which precept no man can with a good conſcience obey, that holds all ſet formes of neceſſity to be caſt out of the Church.</p>

This prayer is lawful, and legitimate; this is ordinary, it muſt be premiſed, it muſt be the foundation of our petitions; and this being laid, then a man may lay his right and claime upon it to build other deſires, other petitions.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115308:76"/>
And as the Ancients would begin with it, ſo alſo they had a care to end with it alſo, it being a comprehenſive prayer,<note place="margin">Directory. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins on the Lords prayer.</note> that whatſoever might be defective in the reſt, this might complete it. And this again is the moſt powerful eloquence to draw God to audience; Could we ſpeak with the tongues of men and Angels, yet certainly our petitions cannot finde ſo eaſie an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into our heavenly Fathers ears, as when we tender them in his Sons own words. This was the judgment both of <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Chryſologus, Qui fecit vivere, docuit &amp; orare, ut dum prece &amp; oratione, quam filius do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, apud patrem loquimur, audiamur: agnoſcit filii ſui verba,</hi>

                        <hi>cum pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem facimus: &amp; in dictandis precibus vota ſupplicum praevenit.</hi> Adde to this, a man is bound to ſay Amen at the end of a prayer; now a man may much ſcruple whether he is bound to ſay Amen to ſuch a prayer, which he hath not time to weigh, which he hath not time to conſider. For put caſe that he who takes upon him to ſpeak unto you in the Name of God,<note place="margin">Chryſologus in eadem.</note> ſhall teach ſome falſe doctrine, or covertly deliver unto the people ſome er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; and after pray that God would bleſſe the ſeed which he hath ſown; is it not dangerous to joyne with him in his deſires? Such a thing may poſſibly fall out. And this inconvenience is quite removed, partly by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning this prayer, partly by uſing thoſe forms the Church hath enjoyned, to which a man may upon deliberation ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this is not the ſole example we have in the New Teſtament patterns for ſet formes. The Apoſtle nine times reiterates the ſame words. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you all.</hi> And to put the matter out of doubt, the Saints for their victory over the Beaſt, ſang the triumphal ſong, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Iſraelites ſang of old, when they were delivered from the Egyptians.

And here I cannot chooſe but put you in minde of a paſſage of Maſter <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> which I have ſeen in a little Manual of his in anſwer to one that charg'd him as an enemy to ſet formes; To which his reply was, that he was ſo farre from this conceit, that if any were pleaſed to come to <hi>Coventry</hi> (where he then did preach) and hear his Lectures, they ſhould before and after his Sermons hear the ſame prayers uſed by him, except that portion of Scripture upon which he inſiſted, gave him occaſion to adde ſome few words. I ſhall ſhut up this point with the judgement and practice of Maſter <hi>Calvin;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Calvin. epiſt. ad Protect.</note> his judgement he hath fully declared in his Epiſtle to the Protectour then, <hi>Quod ad formulam precum, &amp;c.</hi> As for formes of Prayers, and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical rites, I very much approve, that it be ſet or certain. From which it may not be lawful for the Paſtours in their function to depart, that ſo there may be proviſion made for the ſimplicity and unskilfulneſſe of ſome, and that the conſent of all the Churches among themſelves may more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear: and laſtly alſo, that the extravagant levity of ſome who affect novelties may be prevented. Thus he. And his practice is evident, The Liturgy by him compoſed for <hi>Geneva</hi> being yet extant.</p>
                     <p>I am no Prophet, nor the ſonne of a Prophet, yet thus much I dare be bold to fore-caſt, that when all hears and animoſities being depoſed, men ſhall returne to an humble, ſober and Chriſtian temper, ſome forme or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for prayer will be judged neceſſary to be compoſed, ſet forth &amp; enjoyned, without which the diſlocated parts of a Church will never kindly joyne. The experience of the preſent diſtractions ever ſince a ſet forme, as you in a Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſme call them, ſtinted prayers, hath been caſt out of the Church, will make men wiſer for the future.</p>
                     <p>Let men in private uſe what forms they pleaſe, and chooſe their own helps, to which they may adde, as occaſion requires, words ſuited to their preſent neceſſities: But when they are to joyn with the Church, the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being ſuch as are more neceſſary for the whole Corps of Chriſtians, than for any one part, fit it is, that the mother be judge what is uſeful for her children, and teach them what and how to aske. Leave men to their own inventions, and poſſible it is, that the petition be not framed to the preſent exigent, which the Church in all particulars hath taken care of. Yet if this fall out, another inconvenience there is, that too often happens; Theſe extempore men dealing by their prayers, as ſchool-boyes do by their leſſons, or Muſicians with their plain ſong: Thoſe the children vary into ſo many formula's for want of judgement, till they come to non-ſenſe: and the unskilful artiſts run ſo far in their diviſions and deſcants, till they marre the plain-ſong. And the like will happen to thi, great ſervice of God, when it ſhall fall to the variations &amp; deſcants of inartificial ſwaines, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie-headed

                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude with the words of a wiſe man, I never yet could ſee any reaſon why any Chriſtian ſhould abhorre, or be forbidden to uſe the ſame forms of prayer, ſince he prayes to the ſame God, believes in the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, profeſſeth the ſame Truths, reads the ſame Scriptures, hath the ſame duties upon him, and feels the ſame wants daily, for the moſt part both inward and outward, which are common to the whole Church. When we deſire the ſame things, what hinders, but we may uſe the ſame words? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we meaſure our God to be like our own appetites and ſtomachs, which are beſt pleaſed with freſh and freſh.

                     <p>The Rubrick I have conſulted, and I meet not with any poſture at all preſcribed at the ſinging of any Hymne or Pſalme. But ſay it had, ſome poſture or other muſt be uſed, and had it been the worſe, becauſe preſcribed? I trow not. For preſcriptions in adiaphorous things doth not ſo alter their natures, as to make them nought; to proſtrate the body in prayer, to lift up the eyes and pure hands, are actions of indifferency; and do they become nought, becauſe God in his Word preſcribes them? God in his Word hath given the Church liberty to preſcribe in theſe things; <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order;</hi> Say then the Church had preſcribed by the Rubrick, that a man ſhould have ſtood, have kneeled, have ſate, have lift up his eyes and hands at the ſinging of this or that Pſalme reſpectively; ſhe might have done it, and the ſinging of the Pſalme had been nere the more un-Chriſtian, had the Rubrick poſture been obſerved. You needed not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have girded at this, and the rather becauſe it was not. But I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eſcape you, not the poor boy, the Quiriſter. But happily you will ſay, you take it in a larger ſenſe, and by it mean the whole Quire, and ſo I think you do, and therefore I ſhall ſhape my anſwer accordingly.</p>

The ſongs anſwered to their <hi>Schirum,</hi> which were peculiar ſongs compoſed for ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral bleſſings; praiſes they continued, but in a more large and univerſal ſenſe. When any of theſe were expreſſed by voice and inſtrument together, they were called properly Pſalms; when by voice alone without the concent of inſtruments, they were named Hymns and ſongs.<note place="margin">Zanchy in loc.</note> This is the deſcant that the Learned have uſed in their Expoſitions of theſe words; &amp; that we are hence to collect, is, that Muſick hath its uſe in the ſervice of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By this the honour of God is more magnified and celebrated, then it could be by a ſtill and ſoft voice.

The concealment of Gods praiſe did never like him, no nor the cold expreſſion of it, as if men would ſlip it over; it hath been beſt pleaſing to him, when it hath been moſt made known: And therefore he hath had in all Ages perpetual remembrances of what he hath done, Chronicles, Annals, Books of Record. Theſe indeed ſpeak out his noble Acts, but it is for the moſt part to the Wiſe and Learned. But let but one of theſe be conveyed into a ſong, and it will quickly be upon the tongue of the unlearned; you ſhall have the Maid at her wheele, the Prentice in the ſhop warbling upon it; and if any be skilful in Muſick, it will pleaſe him to ſing to his Harp or Viol the wonderful works of God. The praiſes of our God are conveyed into the ſoul with more delight, are faſtned with more affection, are perpetuated to ſucceeding ages with more certainty, when they are meaſured out by Hymns.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This is one reaſon; but this is not the ſole; for this is done to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.

                     <p n="3">3. And yet I do not, I dare not ſay it doth not teach; for are there not good inſtructions in Pſalms? not many profitable leſſons in Anthynms? and theſe by the ſweetneſſe of melody find the eaſier entrance, and longer entertainment.

                  <p>All this we diſclaim as well as you, and you needed not have ſaid, that it begun in this Iſland and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as if it begun with you: for it begun more then one hundred years ſince; aſſume not therefore that to your ſelves, which was done to your hands; to take down this head was the work of the National Church you ſo ſlight, and had it not been done to your hands, I doubt whether all the power you could make, had ever been able to have done it. And for this, that head being of a revengeful nature, hath ever ſince been plotting which way it might unroot us that unrooted it; For the proof of this I ſhall acquaint you, with what a friend acquainted me and others about five years ſince. A good Proteſtant he is now, but about 30. years before, was as he confeſſ'd, reconciled to <hi>Rome,</hi> by one <hi>Meredith</hi> an ancient and learned <hi>Jeſuite</hi> (for he was one of thoſe that Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> had to deal with in <hi>France.</hi>) This man told him that in <hi>England</hi> they had been long and induſtrious about their work of converſion; but it went on ſlowly, and ſo would till they took a wiſer courſe. Two things there were that muſt be done before they ſhould bring their buſineſſe to a full effect. They muſt firſt find a way to remove the Biſhops and Miniſters, in whoſe room they muſt bring it ſo about, that all ſhould have liberty to preach. Then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they muſt get down the Common Prayer book, and ſuffer every man to uſe what prayer he liſt. Thus much the man offer'd to make good upon his Oath before any Magiſtrate he ſhould be call'd. And now I pray tell me out of what ſhop do you think your work comes? That generation are a ſly ſubtle people; as the devil, they can transform themſelves into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light. If many printed books lye not, there have been many among you, and they know to inſinuate their poyſon under guilded pills. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions they have many like your's, and beware leaſt when you think you ſuck in the Truth, you drink not poyſon. <hi>Verbum ſat Sapienti.</hi> They owe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115308:84"/>
us a ſplene for caſting off their head; and they will never give over to ſeek a revenge.</p>
                  <p>We were the men that cut it off, and take heed leaſt unwittingly you ſet it not on again. 'Tis too true; I ſpeak it with grief; they have won to their ſide in the time of our diſſentions more proſelites then they did in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers years before. The Laws are now ſilent, and any man may be now any thing, ſo he be not an old Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that if he profeſſe, then there will be a quick eye upon him; An Ordinance ſhall be ſure to reach him, which for ought I heard is but <hi>brutum fulmen</hi> to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Boaſt not then of your taking down that ſame vile and virulent head the Pope, when it is permitted to ſtand in more favour then a Proteſtant, whoſe work hath been to take down that abominable beaſt with his ten horns as you call him.</p>

For how many violent heads in your ſenſe, meaning National Churches, have their <hi>bene,</hi> who yet have obtained victories? Sometimes God puniſheth a people for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a King, ſometimes a King for the tranſgreſſion of his people. <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſmitten with the peſtilence for <hi>Davids</hi> ſinne, and <hi>Eli</hi> is caſt off, and the Ark taken for the ſinne of his ſons. Where therefore there may be divers cauſes of a diſcomfiture, is overmuch raſhneſſe to fix upon one, nay, to imagine that to be the cauſe, which was not, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he was.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A violent head.] For what I pray? is it a ſinne for a Prince to be the head, that is, the governour of a National Church? ſo you ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme. Beware, look about you, and conſider with whom at unawares you joyne, for the Jeſuite will make you a low Congee, and thank you that you ſhall aſſert their rebellious poſition, that Princes and ſupreme Magiſtrates have nothing to do in the Church; in temporal things ſupreme, and Lords they are, but in ſpiritual matters they may not meddle. The difference lies onely in this, that they would draw the Supremacy to one, even, that man of ſinne, and advance him to the head-ſhip. You draw the Supremacy to the Paſtours and Elders in every Combinational Congregation, and ſo there ſhould be as many ſupremacies and heads, as there be of theſe Churches.</p>
                  <p>For which his Highneſſe the Lord Protectour hath little reaſon to thank you; for of what Church will you make him a governour? Not of the National, that was the Kings ſinne; a violent head he was, and God forbid that according to your tenet any ſhould come into that place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. His headſhip and government can extend no farther than the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binational, that very Combinational, of which he is a member, &amp; in which he muſt act not as Protectour, or the Supreme in the Nation, but as an Elder only. In all other Combinationals he hath nothing at all to do, for they have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy among themſelves. He may not then order National Faſts, nor dayes of Thankſgiving; he may not make Ordinances to eject ſcandalous and ignorant Miniſters; he may not ſet up Approvers of Miniſters for the whole Nation; he may not puniſh Papiſts, impriſon Blaſphemers, ask any man out of his Combination, why he doth ſo or ſo, if your poſition be true. 'Tis violence, 'tis uſurpation, 'tis tyranny. Supreme he is now in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by the power of the ſupremacy all theſe things are done, and you and I, or any body elſe would be ſmiled at, if not frowned upon, that for this ſhould call him a violent head. And what did the Britiſh King more than this?</p>
                  <p>It may be thought, that I have put in this plea in favour of the Britiſh King; he needs it not, for he hath long ago anſwered for his violence, if there were any. I tell you plainly I plead for his Highneſſe, and for as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115308:86"/>
who are ſupreme in any Nation, be they Potentates, Princes or gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours over any Chriſtian Church. For the cauſe is alike in all, and they have external government of the Church in charge; and to ſay the contrary, is to open a ſluce to the over-flowings of impiety. I ſhall put you a caſe. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Jew ſhould be admitted into a Nation, and ſhall fall to their old work of crucifying children to the ſcorn and diſgrace of our Saviour; ſay that a Heathen ſhould be enfranchized, and worſhip the Sunne and the Moon, and all the hoſt of heaven, yea, and make their children paſſe through the fire to <hi>Moloch;</hi> Be it that one ſhould ſay he were God, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil; a third acknowledge not God nor Devil; ſay there ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, one who will blaſpheme and ſay he is the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and rejoyceth to hear Hoſanna cryed before him; If there be no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme over a National Church, I wonder what order could be taken with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe? ſuffered they muſt be to go on, and blaſpheme ſtill, for any power you have to reſtrain them. Convent them before your Congregation, they appear not. Caſt them out, if they be of your Combination, they regard it not. The gangrene goes on, the blaſphemy increaſeth, and will increaſe, except you admit of one ſupreme head in a Nation, who may have ſo much power over the body, that he may cut off that part from the body, which is like to infect and poyſon the whole. The miſchief that may enſue upon a Church by the admiſſion of this your paradox is unconceivable. I can never enough admire the wiſdome both of God and man, who hath appointed a ſupreme power in all Nations, for the ſuppreſſion of all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. With their Civil power I am not at this time to meddle; I ſhall only inſiſt upon that which is Eccleſiaſtical; and that you may the better go along with me, I ſhall reduce what is to be ſaid to certain heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt work of the ſupremacy is to call Aſſemblies. For, for men to aſſemble together, without leave of the ſupreme power, and conſult of Religion, is to make a Rout. <hi>In Iſrael God commands Moſes to make two Trumpets,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 10.12.</note> 
                     <hi>and to keep them for that end to call the Congregation. Moſes had no other right but that of the chief Magiſtrate. In that right he received his Trumpets, and in that right he had the property of both. Aaron,</hi> verſe 10. <hi>had the uſe, but the uſe only, never the right.</hi> May be if we call fleſh and blood to counſel, it will be thought more convenient, that God delivered one Trumpet to one, and the other to the other, and ſo have power to call; but God ſaith peremptorily to <hi>Moſes, erunt tibi,</hi> they ſhall be and remain in thy hands: and ſo, no man hath power to remove the Camp, to aſſemble the Congregation, to found to the Celebration of the ſolemn Feaſts, but <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Succeſſours.</p>
                  <p>By vertue of this power, <hi>Joſhua aſſembles all the Tribes, Levi and all to Sichem.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joſhua 24. 1 Chr. 15.4. &amp; 23.2, 3, 6. 2 Chr. 15. &amp; 20.3. &amp; 24.5 &amp; 34.29.</note> 
                     <hi>David calls together the Prieſts and other Eccleſiaſtical perſons;</hi> and for what matters? for ſecular? nay, meer Church-work; firſt, <hi>when the Ark was to be removed;</hi> again, <hi>when the offices of the Temple were to be ſet in order:</hi> things meerly pertaining to Religion. <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Joas, Joſias,</hi> gave a ſolemn call in matters of Religion. But the fact of <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> is of all moſt memorable. <hi>He gave forth a precept for the Priests, and all
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115308:86"/>
their brethren to aſſemble;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chr. 29. Verſe 12, &amp;c. Verſe 15.</note> and to what end? <hi>ad res Jehovae. There be four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men, chief men of the Prieſts ſet down there by name, that by vertue of that Writ came together, they and their brethren all ex praecepto regis ad res Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovae,</hi> for matters meerly of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus it was while there was a King in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But after, when the Scepter was departed, how was it then? how, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles was come in? who then called the Aſſemblies? A time there was after Chriſt, when Kings were Infidels, and the Church under perſecution. As the Jews at <hi>Babylon,</hi> being under preſſures, they muſt meet, and did, as they could; and yet divers ſuch meetings in Synods we finde recorded, as I have inſtanced before, which for the preſent were called by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs.</p>
                  <p>But no ſooner did God raiſe up <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to be a nurſing father to the Church, but he reſumed the right of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and his Succeſſours lay claim to them at this day; the four general Councils, the great Nicene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Arrius;</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Macedonius;</hi> the third of <hi>Epheſus</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> the fourth of <hi>Calchedon</hi> againſt <hi>Eutichus,</hi> were all called by ſeveral Emperours. And by the ſame power all other National and Provincial Synods have been accuſtomed to be aſſembled till this our age.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And the Church being aſſembled by this Warrant, had power to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Laws for the Diſcipline of the Church, ſo they be conſonant to the Word of God, tend to edification, decency and order; So that if there be no errour of man concerning their determination, the determining of them is to be accompted as if it were divine. Though then he who is the chief in any State, hath not power to determine <hi>judicio definitivo,</hi> what is ſound and to be received in the worſhip of God; yet <hi>judicio executivo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Synod at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge in New Engl. cap. 2.</note> he may and ought when the Church hath determined, command the profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in his Territories; and from this I do not ſee that your Synod held at <hi>Cambridge</hi> doth much diſſent. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto opened unto you what the ſupreme power may do. I ſhall now ſhew you by what right he may do it, which is indeed by all right, <hi>jure naturae, jure divino, &amp; poſitivo.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, they deceive and are deceived, who go about to perſwade that the ſupremacy in Church matters is derived unto any ſuperiour by municipal Laws; for this is a right with which he is inveſted by God himſelf.

                  <p n="2">2. Thus it was, while reaſon bare the ſway. But now let us look into the Scripture. How is it written in the Law, how read you? There it was ordained, <hi>that the King ſhould have a book of the Law, written by the Prieſts,</hi> and the end was,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.18, 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>that he might fear the Lord, and keep it.</hi> And in this Law there be many precepts that concern him as a man, many as a Prince; for as <hi>Auſtin Rex ſervit Deo, aliter qua homo, aliter qua Rex,</hi> as a man by a holy Converſation, as a Prince by making and executing holy conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">Auſtin Ep. <hi>50.</hi>
                     </note> As he is the Superiour, he is there made the Guardian of Gods Law, and the whole Law is committed to his charge. By vertue of which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, when the Kingdome and Prieſthood were divided, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate made uſe of his power over <hi>Aaron,</hi> and reproved him for the golden Calf. <hi>Joſhua</hi> a Prince, no Prieſt, by the ſame authority circumciſed the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> erected an Altar of ſtone, cauſed the people to put away their ſtrange gods, and renewed the Covenant betwixt God and the people. And what other Kings did, you have heard before. Theſe Acts of theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Kings performed in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, ſhews clearly what power Kings had under <hi>Moſes</hi> Law. And one thing more let me put you in mind of, that when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that was a ſupreme power, for it was no more, every man did that which was good in his own eyes, and that good was extream bad, as the ſtory ſhews.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea, but it may be ſaid, that thus it was, while the Judicials of <hi>Moſes</hi> were in force; but why ſo now? Now the Superiours authority is confined to Civil Lawes: Now the Kingdome is Chriſts, and he muſt rule. Indeed could we finde in the Goſpel any reſtriction, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revocation of what power had formerly belonged to Superiours, this plea were conſiderable, but ſince the rule is true, that <hi>Evangelium non tollit precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta naturae &amp; legis, ſed perficit.</hi> The Commiſſion once granted to the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, by nature, and the Moral Law muſt be good.</p>

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:115308:87"/>And be it that the Kingdome is Chriſts, and all power in his hands; yet this will be no impediment to what I contend for neither. That Chriſt wants no Vicar on earth, but as head of his Church doth govern it, is a truth beyond exception. But this is to be underſtood of the ſpiritual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal government; not of that which is external; becauſe he muſt be ſerv'd with the body, as well as with the Spirit, in an outward forme of worſhip, as well as an inward; therefore he hath left ſuperiours to look to that. Their power extends not, their accompt ſhall not be given for what is done within; for they cannot ſee, nor cannot judge what is done in that dark cell; they have nothing to do with the ſecret affections of the heart, with the ſacred gifts of the Spirit, with the ſtedfaſt truſt of future things. They are only to moderate and direct the outward actions of godlineſſe and honeſty, and what may externally advance Chriſts Kingdome. So that the queſtion is not here of the internal, and properly Spiritual; but of the external govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, order, and diſcipline of the Church; which when the ſupreme pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er adminiſters as it ought, it ſets up, and no way pulls down the Kingdome of Chriſt. Theſe two are then well enough compatible, that the Kingdome is Chriſts, and yet the Superiour way make uſe of his power in Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>A Propheſie there was, that under the Goſpel <hi>Kings ſhould be nurſing fathers, and Queens nurſing mothers to the Church.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 49.23.</note> Nouriſhment then they muſt give; that ordain'd for babes; that for men, the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they cannot give; no more then <hi>Uzziah</hi> could burn incenſe, or <hi>Saul</hi> burn Sacrifice; no, nor yet ordain any to do it: The ſuſtenance then which Chriſtians are to receive from them, muſt be that of external diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and government. Thoſe that gave ſuch food were call'd nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; thoſe that denyed it, tyrants and perſecutors; without the favour and execution of this duty, Chriſtian Religion had never been ſo highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd; and therefore the Apoſtle ordains, <hi>that Chriſtians pray for thoſe in authority, that we may live a quiet and a peaceable life in all godlineſſe,</hi>

Thus you ſee reaſon, Law and Goſpel have given a ſupremacy to thoſe in power, <hi>non ſolum in ijs quae pertinent ad humanam ſocietatem, verum etiam in ijs quae attinent ad religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem divinam.</hi>

                  <p>I have enlarg'd my ſelf on this ſubject beyond my intention, leaſt you ſhould ſplit upon that dangerous rock of Jeſuitiſme, while out of a diſlike of the Britiſh King, you make him a violent head of the National Church; for what you ſay of him, is as true of all others; and what is denyed of him, is denyed of all others, in that their claim and right is all alike; and in caſe it be not juſt, their violence and uſurpation is all alike, which to affirm is perfect Jeſuitiſme; And whereſoever this doctrin is turn'd into practice, it ſets up <hi>regnum in regno:</hi> and if it ſhould be brought into this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, would reduce again what <hi>Henry</hi> the eight caſt out, though under
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115308:88"/>
another notion; for every Elderſhip of a Combinational Church would be perfect Papacy, abſolute, independent, anſwerable to none, to be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by none in Church matters, puniſhable by none but themſelves; to which if you will give a right name, it is meere Popiſh power.</p>
                  <p>This is it which Superiours have wiſely diſclaimed, and not admitted themſelves like children to be cheated out of their native rights and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes, as they muſt if you deny a National Church; for that power is in vain which hath no ſubject to work upon; on the Church National it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, becauſe in your opinion it is not; on the Combinational it may nor, becauſe that is abſolute, and to be order'd and diſciplin'd by its own Elders; <hi>non datur tertium;</hi> and ſo the ſupremacy which all Superiours challenge is fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p>To this the Britiſh King did never yield nor would; and I beleeve his Highneſſe will be as little perſwaded by you. For this you make him leſſe victorious and more vincible; but you caſt up your accompt too ſoon; for had you ſaid, for the male adminiſtration of his ſupreme power this had fallen upon him, that might have carried ſome colour of ſenſe with it, (which will alſo happen to any that ſhall not uſe it as they ought) but to affirme, that the claim to the power, and exerciſe of that power was the cauſe of his fall, is raſh, falſe, inconſiderate, dangerous.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115308:88"/>

And the Metaphor is very apt. For the Church is the houſe of the living God, the builder is God, the Miniſters of the Word the Architects; that then their work go evenly and conformably on, they had need of a Canon, or a rule by which the Architects examine their work, leſt the building, ſhould juſt too far outward, or lean too much inward, and ſo deviate from the juſt order and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the proof of this, the Maſter Builder hath left to his under work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men his line and level, which is the Canon of the Scriptures, the doctrin of the Prophets and Apoſtles; whatſoever agrees to this rule, is right and ſound, and Apoſtolick; what is not every way conformable to it, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in exceſſe or defect ſwerves from it, that is, ſuppoſititious, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, erroneous. And now I pray, hath not this Corporation you mention, profeſſed to the world that they receive the books of the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and only thoſe books for their rule and Canon? do they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they fully comprehend all things that are needful for our help? that they are the ſure and infallible rule, whereby may be tryed whether the Church do ſwerve or erre; and whereunto all Eccleſiaſtical doctrin ought to be call'd to account; and that againſt theſe Scriptures, neither Law,<note place="margin">The Engliſh Confeſſion art. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> nor Ordinance, nor any cuſtome ought to be heard; no, though <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, or an Angel from heaven ſhould teach the contrary. How unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed then and inconſiderate is this Epithite of yours, by which you brand us for an Uncanonical Corporation, who ſtick ſo cloſe to the Canon, and have and do maintain it againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would with it, as if it were imperfect, obtrude another Canon upon us? God give you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for this your uncharitable Cenſure, and make you as Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal as we are.

                  <p n="2">2. Now you thought it not enough to put us out of the Canon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you deprived us of the Spirit alſo.

What Sirs, have you ſuch a Monopoly of the Spirit, that none can partake of it, except he be a member of one of your corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Pray ſhew your Charter, produce your Grant, that the Spirit would not deſcend upon any, nor impart his gifts and graces to any, except he were within your Church Covenant; For if that be not the ſole impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſee no colour why you ſhould call us unſpiritual.

                     </gap>; The one peculiarly call'd Graces, the other more properly ſtiled Gifts. The Graces are <hi>media ſalutis immediata,</hi> ſuch by which the good will of God ſhapes the heart within, freely juſtifies a ſinner by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, wonderfully converts a heart of ſtone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a heart of fleſh, clears the conſcience towards God, and ſettles a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come peace. Theſe are <hi>gratiae gratum facientes,</hi> are beſtow'd upon all Gods Saints. The Gifts are <hi>media mediorum,</hi> which it pleaſeth the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

of God to uſe, as fit means to perfect in all his thoſe former gifts of grace, ſuch as are gifts of propheſie, eloquence, utterance, knowledge of tongues, depth of learning, wiſdome in government, functions, and ability to diſcharge theſe functions, &amp;c. And now conſider which of theſe endowments, whether gifts or graces of the Spirit hath not been as eminent and evident in our National corporation as ever it was, or ever will be in your Combinational? I cannot therefore with any patience heare that you ſhould call us unſpiritual; and you, had you had any of the meekneſſe of the Dove in you, would not have done it; ſince you know, that thoſe who have not the Spirit of Chriſt, are none of his: and that you cut us off from Chriſt, can you think that we can take it patiently? There was leſſe charity in this word, then when you writ it I believe you were aware of; and therefore I hope when you write next, you will ſhew more Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love; To conclude the Corporation of which the Britiſh King was head, was as I have prov'd, both Canonical, as adhering to the Canon of the Scriptures; and Spiritual, as endow'd with the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit; and ſo your reaſon hath no reaſon at all in it.

                  <p>A Wonderful demonſtration' The Church muſt be gather'd together in one place to the ſervice of God; as that place of the Corinths proves, and muſt be aſſembled to exerciſe diſcipline, as in that of <hi>Matthew;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there may be no national Church, therefore no head or governour in that Church. <hi>Baculus in angulo;</hi> 'Tis as if you ſhould argue thus; ſuch or ſuch a County muſt meet together to elect a Burgeſſe to the Parliament, or to ſee juſtice done at a Quarter Seſſions, or at an Aſſize; therefore it is inconſiſtent that there ſhould be a head over the Nation, whereof they are parts. Who ſees not the abſurdity of ſuch an argument?</p>
                  <p>But now in particular to theſe places. The firſt is <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. And if he ſhall neglect to hear thee, tell it to the Church, which is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith of it, <hi>dicant qui poſſunt, ſi tamen probare poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt quae dicunt, ego me ignorare profiteor.</hi> And the reaſon is, becauſe the word <hi>Eccleſia</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a term of divers acceptions; and from terms aequivocal nothing can be concluded till diſtinction be made. But this I muſt tell you by the way, that no man by Eccleſia under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Combinational Church, til you aroſe; and therefore you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conclude out of this place, that a head of a National Church is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Chriſts precept. For the Pope, Presbyter, Praelate, all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a National Church, and a head of a National Church, and yet never thought that they did tranſgreſſe Chriſts precept. Your proof therefore cannot ſtand ſecure til you have everted the claim of every one of theſe, no more then til he who pretends a right to a piece of Land, which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115308:89"/>
is in other mens poſſeſſions, hath ſhew'd his own title to be only good, and all the reſt of no force. Be not ſo haſty then with your inference; for there's not one of theſe who will not ſay you are an intruder.</p>
                  <p>It would fill a book to tell you what is written, and what I have read upon this place. Whether by the Church you are to underſtand a civil or an Eccleſiaſtical conſiſtory, or whether a mixt, becauſe our Saviour alludes out of queſtion to the Jewiſh Sanedrim.<note place="margin">Beza Annot. in locum. Rutherf. cap. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> Then whether by the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain you are to underſtand the whole Congregation, or the chief in that Congregation; the Elders ſay the Presbyters only; you, as by <hi>Rutherfords</hi> diſputes againſt you, I gueſſe the whole body of believers; or as the Prelates contend, thoſe to whom Chriſt gave the Keys, meaning the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours. Yet farther, whether the wrong to be here tryed by the Church be only that which is private; becauſe of thoſe words, <hi>If thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treſpaſſe against thee.</hi> Laſtly, whether our Saviour ſpeaks here of any Church cenſure at all, becauſe our Saviour ſaith not, let him be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, but <hi>ſit tibi, Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among many interpretations of theſe words, I ſhall propoſe one, which I preferre above the reſt, as that which to me carrieth the faireſt evidence with it. The Jews were at this time conquered by the Romans, under their power and judicatory; yet they left unto the Jews ſo much power as to judge betwixt man and man, according to the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> reſerving ſtrangers and Publicans to be tryed in the Romane Court. This being the ſtate of the Jews, when our Saviour ſpoke theſe words, in private quarrels and actions Chriſt propoſeth three degrees of proceeding. The firſt by the Rule of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. If thy brother treſpaſſe againſt thee, tell him privately of the wrong offered thee, betwixt thee and him alone: and if this prevail not, in charity go one ſtep further, call two or three Witneſſes and rebuke him before them, manifeſt the wrong; if he hear thee, thou haſt wonne thy brother; there ought to be an end of the debate. This is the firſt direction. 2. But ſay he be yet refractory; then thou mayſt proceed further, even by the order of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, then convent him before the Moſaical Magiſtrate, the Triumvirate, the 23. or the great Sanedrim, the 71. <hi>Dic Eccleſiae.</hi> 3. But if he will not hear them, to which he is bound by <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, then take help from the Romane Soveraignty. Let him be unto thee as a Heathen or Publican; eſteeme him for a brother Jew no longer, but proceed againſt him in that Court where Heathens and Publicans were to take their trial. This is the natural and genuine Expoſition of theſe words; the precept belongs to the ſtate of the Jews at that time, and cannot be applyed to the Chriſtian Church, except by the way of Accommadation. For it is clear that the caſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> put was of private wrong, <hi>Maſter, how often ſhall my brother ſinne againſt me, and I forgive him?</hi> and the caſe is put of a private wrong, <hi>if thy brother ſhall treſpaſſe againſt thee, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas thoſe caſes in which the Church ought to proceed muſt be notorious and ſcandalous, in which it is not neceſſary that the two admonitions precede, either that private, or the other under Witneſſes, neither after ſentence paſt by the Church, is the man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115308:90"/>
to be accompted in the ſtate of a Heathen or Publican; for Chriſt and his Church did never refuſe to converſe with either. So that it as not proper to underſtand theſe words of the Chriſtian Church, which then was not.</p>
                  <p>That yet they may be referred thither, I gain-ſay not; but then that which will be collected from hence, can be no more but this, that in the Church of Chriſt there muſt be a Court erected; And ſo there alwayes hath been; that it be Combinational onely, there is not any man, who looks upon this place with an unpartial eye, can ever ſay that in this place there is a precept for it. He may with more reaſon conclude the contrary, becauſe the Church concerning whom the precept was given, <hi>Dic Eccleſiae,</hi> was the Jewiſh Church, which is confeſſed at that time to have been Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, not Combinational. In this place then you miſſed your mark. As for the other,</p>
                  <p>That to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. I wonder what you can pick out of it for a Combinational Church, much leſſe a precept for it. The words are, <hi>If therefore the whole Church be gathred together in one place, &amp;c.</hi> or as it is in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and that may be about the ſame thing. It puts me to ſtand what you can collect from hence that may ſerve your turn. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you may that the whole Church at that time was ſmall, or ſo many as could conveniently meet together in one place, or that they met about one and the ſame ſervice; but that there was a precept here given, that thoſe which met together muſt be combined in a Church Covenant, is a collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of your own brain. Before your Combination was heard of, the Church met together in Synods Provincial, National, Oecumenical; men met together in one place to ſerve God; and therefore the meeting together in one place will never be inconſiſtent with Scripture precepts. But in caſe theſe two places ſhould prove infirme, you have thought upon your <hi>Optiones,</hi> your ſeconds to undertake the Combate.</p>

                  <p>Theſe places of Scripture I have reviewed, and I do not finde one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115308:90"/>
of the Combinational Church in any of them. Alchymiſts who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe themſelves skilful to extract gold out of a pibble, may perhaps light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſuch thing, but this paſſeth my art. There was a man, who was wont to ſtand upon a Key at <hi>Athens,</hi> and every ſhip that approached the Harbour, he judged to be his own. The like you do by Scripture, and every Text where you can but meet with the name of Chriſts Church, preſently you conceit it makes for your Combinational; had not your head runne this way, you would never have alledged theſe.</p>
                  <p>In that Chapter to the Epheſians, 'tis the Apoſtles purpoſe to ſhew that the partition betwixt Jew and Gentile was by Chriſt taken down, He was laid in the foundation for the cornerſtone, and both Nations built and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him unto one Church, ſo that both by him in one Spirit had acceſſe to the Father. The Gentiles were no more ſtrangers and Forreiners, but fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God, built upon the foundation, Jeſus Chriſt being the corner ſtone, in whom the whole building fitly framed together, growes into a holy Temple. The end was, as you cite, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.15. <hi>That they ſhould be blameleſſe and harmleſſe, and the ſonnes of God, without rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation, among whom ye ſhine as lights in the world.</hi> And theſe were they, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>who were redeemed by Christs blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what could not all this be effected but within your Combination? No fellow-Citizens of the Saints? none blameleſſe and harmleſſe, and ſons of God? none redeemed by Chriſts blood, but thoſe within your Church Covenant? What Arrogance is this? what Papiſme? what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Fye, fye, give over this peeviſh ſingularity, and ſince Chriſt hath redeemed by his blood ſome out of every kindred, tongue, people, Nation; let thoſe whom he hath ſo freely and dearly bought be fellow Citizens with the Saints, whether they be of your Combinational Church or not. The conſequence is very ſad, which may be drawn out of your own words; and if I have forced them beyond your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I am not altogether too blame in it, ſince it may move you hereafter to look, that words which may be conſtrued to an uncharitable ſenſe fall not from you.</p>
                  <p>But yet that I may be more particular in my anſwer, The Apoſtle here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to us the Catholick Church, and not any particular in the judgment of all interpreters, under the ſimilitudes of a City, a Temple, a Houſe, a City which is governed by the ſame Laws under one King, a Temple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the ſame God, and ſanctified by the ſame Spirit; a houſe in which the domeſticks are all under one and the ſame father of the family; The Citizens of this City, the Worſhippers in this Temple, the children, ſervants and attendants in this houſe and family are both Jews and Gentiles. The time was when it was not ſo, for the Gentiles were <gap reason="foreign">

and made fellow-Citizens of the Saints; they were not a people, but now are admitted for his people, but now admitted into his Temple with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to offer praiſe and prayers unto him; nay, which is yet more, are themſelves living ſtones of this Temple; they were afar off, but now are come ſo near, that he acknowledges them for ſonnes and houſhold ſervants. This City is ſo ample, this Temple ſo ſpatious, this houſe ſo great, that it takes in both the Saints triumphing in heaven, and that part alſo of this Corporation yet Militant on Earth, of what Nation ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>This being the full ſcope of the Apoſtle here, I wonder that you ſhould put ſuch a reſtraint upon his words, as to limit them to your Combinations; 'tis overmuch boldneſſe in any part to uſurp and appropriate that to it ſelf, which belongs to the whole.</p>
                  <p>A holy City this is called, you ſay, not a Nation; true 'tis ſo here; yet in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>

                     </gap>, in that the ſame Church, which is a City in one Apoſtle, is a Nation in the other; and then out of the one I ſhall as eaſily prove a National Church, as you out of the other ſhall prove a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binational. A City it was, and who were the Citizens? Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; that is evident in the chapter; now ſay if you can without bluſhing, that ſuch a multitude of all kindreds, languages, nations, people, could combine and meet together in one place; which is one of the ingredients of your Combination, if <hi>Ameſius</hi> ſays true. Farther yet, had it been only of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſpoken, this had been no convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that he ſpoke of a Combinational Church; For that the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were a people, and <hi>Epheſus</hi> the Metropolis of that people, which did impart her priviledges to all thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe, who were under her ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; A City at that time being not taken, as it is now with us, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for one determinate Town, as <hi>London, Briſtol, &amp;c.</hi> but for a whole people which enjoyed the priviledges and immunities of that republick, as in <hi>A hens, Lacedaemon, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> and is now at <hi>Florence, Venice,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places.</p>
                  <p>A holy Temple you ſay it is, and what of that? muſt it therefore be of neceſſity a Combinational Church? this would ſhrink your Combination to a ſmall number; nay to <hi>principium numeri,</hi> to one alone if you preſſe the Metaphor too far; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> asks every Chriſtian, <hi>Know you not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?

                  <p>Yea, and much leſſe out of that which followeth, a ſpiritual houſe.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Church in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely without addition,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> either of National or Combinational, the houſe of God, and who can conceive that the Combinational, as put caſe that of <hi>Swanſea, Ilſton, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould be the pillar to hold out, or the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupport the Truth? This is ſomewhat worſe then thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who plead theſe words for their Church with more colour, with more reaſon; and yet we believe them not, becauſe they are but a particular Church; and why then ſhould we believe you?</p>
                  <p>Obſerve farther the abſurdity that would follow upon your collection. The Church of God is a houſe, therefore it muſt be a Combinational Church.

Two or three years ſince, Sheer Halls, Market Houſes, private Conventicles were the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawful meeting houſes; but now theſe are of no eſteem, none now to the old Fabricks; theſe you frequent, theſe you invade; in theſe you preach, cenſure and break bread. So that it ſeems now, that the Pariſh Parſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned out of dores, all the ill-favouredneſſe and unholineſſe went out with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Againſt this poor Parſon you are very bitter; arraigned he muſt be, brought to the Bar to take his trial.

                  <p>'Tis manifeſt indeed, that all luke-warme, hypocritical Profeſſours, ſhall be ſpued out of Chriſts mouth; for <hi>vomitum faciunt Deo.</hi> To him they are as luke-warme water to the ſtomach that procures a vomit; and if ſo, 'tis good counſel you give him, or any other in his caſe, to receive what ever correction ſhall be as a cordial of love adminiſtred unto him, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of what may follow.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt put you to it, to prove your enditement, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he is under will never do it; <q>

                  <p>This will prove him culpable and guilty, and ſo I admit he was; but whether he were hot or cold, an hypocrite or otherwiſe, is more than you can ever know.

it in what qualification you will, beware upon whom this blow will light, and what a company of precious ones you will preſently endite to be like the luke-warme Angel of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> For how many of your Preachers are now become Parſons? you know they have the fatteſt Benefices of this whole Country. If plurality were an argument of the Pariſh Parſons luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it is theirs. If non-reſidence an argument, they are guilty of it. If handling the fleſh-hook too much, none more guilty. If neglect of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, they cannot be excuſed. If frequent preaching, they exceed. If forbearance of Sacramental adminiſtrations, this by them is ſeldome done. That I ſay not, that in life and example they are no whit better. In Gods name therefore, ſince in luke-warmneſſe they are ſo like the old odde head, the Pariſh Parſon; let them lye down under the laſh with him, and with ſhame and confuſion of face to themſelves, receive a ſharp correction, that they may prevent the ſpuing of their names out of Chriſts mouth, as it is manifeſt by what is foretold, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.19. One thing onely I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, that whereas the old odde head you mention did leaſt harme, this laſt Pariſh Parſon you have impoſed upon us does all the miſchief.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In your concluſion; yet God be thanked, you ſhew more charity to the Pariſh, than to the Parſon; of it you ſay, that the whole half-blind political body doth yet appear not to be utterly uncurable. You do ſo load your ſentences with ſtrong words, that they paſſe my capacity. I know not what to make of this political body of a Pariſh; for I never underſtood they were under any other policy then that of the Common-wealth or Church in which they lived; nor that they were any Corporation at all. I profeſs, I underſtand not what you mean, if you intend any thing beſides this. But whatſoever you intend by it, this I finde that you affirme, the whole was half-blind; they have not yet then loſt their ſight altogether; that little light they have, may in good time make them ſee how they have been delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſo free them from all the fallacies that have been put upon them; which when it happens, both you and I are in hope of their cure. But that you ſay muſt not be expected, ſo long as they remain in their preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For in reſpect of its preſent poſture and numerous abominations, it is altogether unapprovable, and I ſay the ſame too; and upon the very ſelf ſame ground, becauſe it rejects the Commandments of God, that it may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the traditions of men.</p>
                  <p>For what is the whole conſtitution of your Church, but the tradition of men? whats your plea all this while, but a tradition of men? That a company collected under a Covenant, without either Paſtours or Elders is a true Church, is a tradition of men; That they may create, elect, ordain their Paſtours and Elders, is another tradition of men; That the power of the Keys ſubjectively and authoritatively to inveſt and deveſt, is in them: is a third tradition of men. That there muſt be Lay-Presbyters, which muſt be Ruling Elders in the Church, is a fourth tradition of men. That the erection of the Cathedral, Parochial, Provincial, National Church was the corruption of the Combinational, is another tradition of men. That the Supreme power in any Nation is a violent head; the Arch-Biſhop a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115308:96"/>
haughty horrible head; the Dioceſan an idle and addle head; the Pariſh Parſon an odde head, is another of your traditions. That there may be no ſet forms of prayer uſed in the Church, no ſinging of Pſalms in mixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. That the Scripture may not be read in the Church, except expounded. That thoſe Rites which you call but falſly Romiſh and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, may not be uſed in the Church. That Godfathers and Godmothers may not be uſed in Baptiſme, nor the children of thoſe who are out of your Combinational Church baptized. That thoſe whom you uſually call profane, ignorant, ſcandalous perſons, may not be admitted to the Sacrament: That there muſt be an upper ſeat erected for the Elders, to ſit in their ranks, as Aldermen upon the Bench in the Church. That there muſt be Tables ſet up for the maintenance of the Ruling Elders. All theſe are the traditions of men, and doctrines of men; and therefore I give this counſel to the whole half-blinde political body of the Pariſhes, where you have prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moſt, that while they are curable they tender their health; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Scribes and Phariſees, who in vain worſhip God, teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men; and to beware leſt any man ſpoile them through Philoſophy, or vain deceit through the tradition of men, &amp;c. This is a holy watch-word, and a wholeſome warning, and I deſire it may be heedfully hearkned unto by ſuch as are your Church Officers, for then I doubt not, but that they who have ſo much power, and have ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the multitude, might be excellent inſtruments in this cure, and quickly be able to bring back the multitude of Church hearers, from thoſe many above-named obſervations and aberrations, into which they have been cunningly, and in ſimplicity of heart drawn, as thoſe poor Iſraelites were to follow <hi>Abſolon.</hi>

                  <p>The word Tradition in general ſignifies any doctrin or obſervation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd from one to another, either by word or writing, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.14. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.15. &amp; cap. 3.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3.4.</p>
                  <p>The Proteſtants ſimply do not deny Tradition; but firſt we diſtinguiſh of Traditions, and then according to ſome acceptions of the name we admit thereof, with a ſubordination to holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, the Romaniſts maintain there be doctrinal Traditions, or Traditions that contain Articles of Faith, and ſubſtantial matters of divine worſhip and religion,<note place="margin">Decret. prim. <hi>4.</hi> Seſſ. Syn. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</note> not found in the holy Scripture; and that theſe are <hi>pari pietatis affectu ac reverentia ſucipiendae, ac venerandae</hi> with Scripture, and to be believ'd no leſſe then the prime Articles; ſuch are Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, Invocation of Saints, the Popes infallibility, &amp;c. Theſe, and all other ſuch Traditions, containing new parts and additions to religion, the Proteſtants ſimply condemn and renounce.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, the name of Tradition in the writings of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Doctours and Fathers is taken in three other ſenſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for external Rights and Ceremonies of decency, order, and outward profeſſion of religion not found expreſſely in the holy Scripture, but uſed as things adiaphorous, being not of the ſubſtance of divine worſhip; but only acceſſary, as the ſign of the Croſſe; and many of thoſe, you in your following words mention; and theſe we ſay may be uſed, or diſuſed according to the Laws of every Church, as they ſerve for aedification, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The report of the Primitive Church concerning matter of fact, and concerning the practice of the Apoſtles is another Tradition; as that the Apoſtles did baptize infants; that they admitted none to the Lords Supper, but thoſe who were of years to examine themſelves; that they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd ſuch and ſuch in ſeveral Churches to be Biſhops; That, that very Canon of Scripture which we now maintain, was the Canon at that time with many other, which can be beſt prov'd by Tradition. And therefore we willingly admit of theſe Traditions alſo deliver'd unto us by the Hiſtories and Records of the Church, becauſe ſuch reports explicate the meaning, or confirm the doctrin of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſumme of Chriſtian faith, as the Creed, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſtian doctrin in many principal parts thereof, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Trinity, Incarnation, deſcent of Chriſt into hell, &amp;c. is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call'd Tradition, being receiv'd from hand to hand, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles lively teaching; and ſuch Tradition found unanimouſly in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we admit alſo, becauſe it gives light to the doctrine found in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>But in the admittance of theſe we require two Cautions.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:115308:97"/>1. That the holy Scripture be the rule of all Traditions whatſoever thus far, that they be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, up on examination conformable to the Scriptures, and every way ſubſervient to the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they have the Teſtimony of the primitive Church in the prime age thereof, and deſcend to our days from the ſame, by the ſtream of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion through ages following, and were received as Apoſtolick in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion of Traditions being thus ſtated unto you, eaſie it will be to anſwer to your two alleag'd Texts of Tradition, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. For they make as much to your purpoſe, as <hi>Ecce duo gladij</hi> doth to confirme the Popes claim to the Temporal and Spiritual power; or <hi>Paſce oves,</hi> to uphold his Supremacy; Or God made two great lights, to prove the Popes power to be above the Emperours, as much as the Sun exceeds the Moon; or that Parſon who would undertake to prove the Pariſh muſt pave the Church, and not he, becauſe it was written in the Prophet, <hi>paveant illi, ego non pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For how doth that place of <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7.9. pertain to the ſpiritual, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical, or interpretative Traditions of the Chriſtian Church. It was of the Scribes and Phariſees of whom our Saviour there ſpoke, and of their Traditions; of waſhing of pots and cups, and many ſuch other like things of their Corban. And in their waſhings they placed not decency and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but made a matter of Religion of it; and by their Corban they took away the duty of the fifth Commandment. Look into the place you urge, and tell me whether I ſay not truth; and this it ſeems you ſaw, and that made you skip over the 8. verſe, and never mention the 11. which if you had done, and weigh'd, you would not for ſhame have equall'd our Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with theirs; or judged us as ſuperſtitious for obſerving our Traditions, as they were for theirs. We have a command for the inſtitution of our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; <hi>let all be done decently, in order, and to edification;</hi> we have good authority that our Traditions are Apoſtolical, we obſerve them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Command, <hi>Honour thy father and mother,</hi> who have authority in indifferent things. And therefore your imputation is raſh; for we reject no Commandment of God, by receiving the commands of men. Beſides, you know we never maintain'd theſe as <gap reason="foreign">

Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the Apoſtle here condemns not, as all note upon the place, but as it had vanity and deceitfulneſſe added to it; for a man may condemn the ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and knavery of any art, that likes the art well enough. The Traditions of men he utterly diſlikes, ſuch as were accompanied with ſuperſtition and folly; as were thoſe of the Phariſees diſliked by our Saviour, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                  <p>This is the true intent, ſcope and ſenſe of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, as the wiſe and judicious Interpreters have taught me.

                  <p>For let the Queſtion then be propoſed, whether it can be proved from theſe places, that all Traditions and external Rites brought into the Church by men, ought to be exploded, ejected, condemn'd? And I anſwer, No; partly for that theſe texts aim at another matter, partly, becauſe there muſt be power granted to the Governours of the Church, to inſtitute rites for order and decency; the Apoſtle himſelf being the Authour of it, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi>

The Monarchical Pue is exalted above the Miniſterial Pulpit, it is put in its place, in ſtands in ſtead of it; were there no other, yet this were a ſtrong plea of a ſtrange Apoſtacy. <hi>Quis audivit talia?</hi> ſuch an abomination ought not to be committed in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Conſider of it, take advice and ſpeak your minds.

All other injuries and abominations might have been paſſed by, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this: The Communion-book-praying might have been remitted; The Homily-book-preaching might have been forgotten; the Canon-book-ſwearing might have been buried, the bare-headed Prieſts, the babbling reading of two Chapters; All the Romiſh rites, the humane inventions, the bands of Matrimony, the Ring in Marriage, the ſign of the Croſſe, that ſmock of the Whore, the Quiriſters cherping, the ſermons at funerals, and the reſt of that trumpery might have been forgiven and pardoned, had it not been for this preſumptuous pue, and narrow Coop: For if there had been nothing amiſſe or out of order in theſe Pariſh meeting houſes; yet the meer ſight of a Monarchical Pue, ſuffer'd to ſtand in the ſtead of a Miniſterial Pulpit, is plea and argument ſtrong enough, that the Pariſh is Apoſtate, not guilty of a ſmall offence, ſome venial ſin or peccadillo; but fallen from grace, lapſed into that heinous guilt of Apoſtacy, and degenerated from the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians. By this the Elders are kept out from taking the higheſt place in the Synagogues, by this they are hindred to ſit round about the throne, by this they cannot ſit on the right and left hand, as Mother <hi>Zebedee</hi> deſired for her children in Chriſts Kingdome; by this they are excluded to ſtand and ſit together in the face and full view of the whole aſſembly, by which notice might be taken of them for prime and principal men; and a fearful trembling might fall upon any of the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that ſhould incur their indignation, no otherwiſe then a Malefactour is terrified at the ſight of his judge. Away then with this ſame Monarchical pue, this pinfold, this coop, ſince it is an obſtruction and derogation to the Miniſterial Pulpit, and Elders Bench; 'tis a Remonſtrance of Monarchy, and a Relick of Popery; and ſince Monarchy is thrown aſide, and Popery with it, <hi>hew this alſo down, and cast it into the fire:</hi> So ſhall we have theſe meeting houſes reformed and reſtored to their primitive conſtitution, room made for the Elders to ſit in their places, that they may begin and end all the publick Ordinances, and tranſact all the open concemments of the City of God. This a rare device, and at after I ſhall tell you what I think of it; in the Interim I return to conſider of your Ironical paraleipſis, in which you make your ſelf merry with many particulars; the uſe of which you ſcoff at as abominations in the Pariſh meeting houſes; and the firſt of theſe was.</p>

               <p>St. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> calls all his Sermons Homilies, and if you look into the Ancients, thoſe Lectures which they made to the people, eſpecially upon the Epiſtles and Goſpels, were call'd Homilies; the word both in Greek and Latine authours is very ancient. To the word therefore, I ſee no reaſon you ſhould except no more then preaching, which in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that ſignifies to proclaim, as a Herauld, the Word of God; now whether this be within, or without book, is not material. The Sheriff reads a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, what then? does he not therefore proclaim it? And a man reads a Sermon to the people, and this materially is the Word of God, ſuch that for the truth of it you dare not except againſt; ſhall you then diſavow it barely for the reading? This is a childiſh exception, yea, and very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous alſo;<note place="margin">Hook. Eccl. pol. lib. 5. pag. 51.</note> For then it would neceſſarily follow, that the vigour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal efficacy of Sermons doth grow from certain outward accidents, which are not in them, but in their maker; his virtue, his geſture, his countenance, his zeal, the motion of his body, and the inflection of his voice, who firſt uttereth them as his own, is that which giveth them the form, the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the eſſenſe of inſtruments available to eternal life. Put caſe a man cannot read, but deſires to have a Sermon read unto him, of Mr. <hi>Cottons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Burroughs, &amp;c.</hi> I would now ask you, whether any good might come of it or no; if not, to what end are they publiſhed? what meerly to publiſh to the world, that the man is a man of rare parts, and to no benefit of the Reader? But if this laſt, in earneſt tell me why that the auditory may not be as much benefited by the Church Homilies read unto them, as they may be by any private mans works? ſhould you nor I find any profit by what we read, we might caſt away our books.</p>
               <p>Had indeed the reading of theſe Homilies, quite excluded Preaching, you had had ſome colour to except againſt them; but the words of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick are theſe, If there be no Sermon, then ſhall follow one of the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies already ſet forth; So that it preſuppoſeth there ſhould be a Sermon; but in caſe there be not, (as if you look into the paucity of Miniſters able to preach; when that Conſtitution was made, it was not poſſible there ſhould be) then it ordains Homilies to be read, which only differ from a Sermon in this, that the man hath it not without book. Put caſe one of your own ſhould in one Church read a Sermon that is in print; and in another, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to memory, preach it to the people; would you not ſay that he did <gap reason="foreign">

Indulge as much to us, and then we will ſay, he that reads, and after committing the ſame homily to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory delivers it without book, Preacheth. In a word, Impartially conſider theſe Homilies, that they are found for doctrin, plain for the ſtile, compoſed of the moſt neceſſary points of Religion, and framed to the capacity of the vulgar; ſo that thoſe Miniſters that were wont to read them, had taken the pains to have learned them without book, <hi>&amp; viva voce</hi> have delivered them to the auditory, you had wanted what to ſay againſt them.</p>

               <p>The Reply.</p>
               <p>To cover or uncover the head in theſe places in the time of divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is a Ceremony; and therefore if the obſervation, or non-obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Ceremonies be a ſuperſtition, he that uncovereth not his head, may be as ſuperſtitious as he who is bare-headed. The reaſon is, becauſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which we uſually tranſlate ſuperſtition, hath <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> a fear in it, which proceeds from an imbecillity of the underſtanding, which fears where no fear is; is afraid that God will be diſpleaſed if ſuch or ſuch an external act be omitted, or ſuch or ſuch an act done; when one and the other may be omitted and done, as occaſions and circumſtances offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and God no way diſpleaſed. The covering or uncovering of the head is one of theſe Ceremonies; and he that thinks he may not be unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered out of a fear to offend God, is ſuperſtitious, yea, while he ſpeaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Ceremonies, is Ceremonious: And he that thinks upon no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he may cover his head, is Ceremonious alſo; and yet for his ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath a fairer excuſe than the other. For the one doth it for the moſt part out of contempt and perverſeneſſe, and in a diſobedience to ſome higher power; the other out of a kind of neceſſity, which his preſent condition may put upon him, (and 'tis a certain rule that charity diſpenſeth with all Ceremonies.) The one by it, may give occaſion to ſuſpect his irreverence; the worſt that can be made of the other, is, that he deſires to ſerve his God with fear and reverence, as judging himſelf in his preſence, before whom he cannot be too vile. The one, hath no countenance nor colour of any Scripture for what he does; the other looks upon thoſe plain words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Every man praying or propheſying, having his head covered, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honours his head:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.4.</note> and thinks he is obliged to it, as indeed he is, till the meaning of the Text be otherwiſe cleared to him.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then ought to be this, whether a man ought to be covered in the ſervice of God? If uncovered, why do you jear at our bare-heads?
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115308:101"/>
If covered, why do you not keep your own rule, but ſit covered at one part of ſervice, and uncovered at another? covered when a Chapter is read and expounded; covered all the time of Sermon, (which yet I hope you will not deny, is a chief part of Gods ſervice, which if you ſhould deny, I know not how you ſerve God,) and yet uncovered again, at the ſinging of a Pſalm, at your extemporarie, prayers before and after Sermon, at the adminiſtration of the Sacraments. Tell me what priviledge you have to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with this Ceremony in one part of divine ſervice more than another, Let it then be but conſidered who it is that ſpeaks from heaven unto us; that in <hi>voce hominis tuba Dei,</hi> that it is God that ſpeaks by mans mouth, that the meſſage is his, and man onely the Embaſſadour to deliver it; and then I think no man deſerves a ſcoffe, that hears it with a bare head.</p>
               <p>When ſome of your party were preſt with this argument, at laſt they came to this reſult,<note place="margin">Bayly pag. <hi>122.</hi>
                  </note> that there was a neceſſity for all men to keep on their hats all the time of divine actions, more particularly at the time of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament. For this act was a right ſignificant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants of their table-honour and fellowſhip with Chriſt; alſo, that the Miniſter at the Celebration muſt be uncovered, and that in ſigne of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Communicants as the Lords much honoured children, ſitting covered when they eat of their fathers meat. This irreverence with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, if you diſclaim, as I hope you do, it lyes upon you to ſhew me a reaſon, why a man may be irreverent at any other part of Gods worſhip: which I interpret the covering of the head out of contempt and obſtinacy to be, which guilt you may unadviſedly draw upon your ſelf, when you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us in a ſcoffe bare-heads.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Theſe you ſay ſhould be utterly rejected from being my ſpiritual Over-ſeers again.</p>
               <p>What will you caſt us aſide with the ſhavelings of <hi>Rome?</hi> not rejected, but utterly rejected? rejected for a poor Ceremony, that we were bare-headed in Gods ſervice? never to be made ſpiritual Over-ſeers again meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for this? This were a very harſh ſentence; but you lenifie it with two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, that of inward, and an outward calling.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3.</hi> Afore they were inwardly qualified by Chriſts ſinne-crucifying and ſoul-quickning Spirit in a cleanſed conſcience.</p>
               <p>This your qualification is exceedingly to be deſired; O how happy were the Church, if all the Overſeers were quickned by that Spirit, which would effectually work in them a crucifying of ſinne, and a new life, that their conſcience were cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt, and a pure faith! that her Nazarites were purer than ſnow, whiter than milke, that they were more ruddy in body than rubies, and that their poliſhing was as ſaphire. But this is rather to be wiſhed than hoped for; while this world ſtands, <hi>Saul</hi> will be among the Prophets, and <hi>Judas</hi> among the Diſciples. So then you
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115308:101"/>
have here put an impoſſible talk upon your ſelf and all others, to be aſſured of an Over-ſeer before you receive him, that he is inwardly qualified by Chriſts ſinne-crucifi d and ſoul-quickning Spirit in a cleanſed conſcience. For this requires a great deal of more ability in the Rulers of the Church, than ever can be found in any mortal man: For not to ſpeak of the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a grounded and certain perſwaſion of true grace in the heart of an hypocrite, who hath no grace at all: how is it poſſible to attain to any grounded certainty of true grace in the heart of another man? conjectures we may make, and in charity judge it is ſo, but this is no evidence of aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For the hid man of the heart, and the new name, are not certainly known to any man, but he that hath them. You muſt then abate very much of this propoſition, before any wiſe man will be of your judgment. And if men muſt not be admitted for Over-ſeers, till you know them to be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly qualifyed, nor you nor we ſhall ever admit any Over-ſeers. Gifts I graunt they all ought to have, before they be admitted into that order; but ſuch as men may judge of, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, abilities in learning, outward evidences of grace witneſſed by a holy life; but whether they have <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>gratias gratum facientes,</hi> that muſt be left to the ſearcher of all hearts. To us a <hi>Briſtol</hi> ſtone may gliſter like a Diamond, and till we know the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it were folly to reject it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4.</hi> And alſo outwardly and ord rly called by Chriſts Covenant-ſervants in a cleanſed Combinational Church.</p>
               <p>This is your ſecond reſtriction, by which you would reject the Pariſh Over-ſeers as you call them: the old Miniſters. But now ſee how farre it will take hold of thoſe among your ſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For firſt, if this outward calling be neceſſary, then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your Itinerants, who never pleaded this outward call, but their gifts only.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For thoſe old Miniſters that turn unto you, and for gaine dance after your pipe, they then muſt renounce their old orders, and be newly ordained by you; which were, as if a man that had received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from his Prince, ſhould ſlight that, and take up another from the people; that I ſay not it juſtifies that old exploded maxime, laid upon <hi>Wickleive, Praelatus in mortali peccato exiſtens deſinit eſſe Praelatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here you would faſten upon us again the old Sophiſme, that there is no outward and orderly calling but by Chriſts Covenant-ſervants in a cleanſed Combinational Church; which you ſhall make good <hi>ad Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas Calendas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, You ſay that this outward and orderly calling muſt be had in a cleanſed Combinational Church. So that if the Combinational Church be not purifyed and cleanſed, what aſſurance can any man have of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling? Are the Anabaptiſt Churches clean? Are the Antinomians clean? Are the Millenaries clean? Are the Quakers clean? yet all theſe are Combinational, and they ordain their Miniſters. It ſeems then that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115308:102"/>
unclean Combinational Churches both outwardly and orderly call'd: or elſe all theſe have no Paſtours. But I proceed with your words.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>If there were an unanimous voting down of all double-reading, I mean that babling reading of two Chapters, which is not ſeconded with the opening and expounding of the ſame, being that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be confeſſed, that it was ſuch a courſe as is quite contrary to what is commanded and commended in the Scriptures of Truth, as all do well know that are acquainted with what is written, Ezek.</hi> 33.2. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24.</p>

               <p>He that will give forth and maintain a Paradox contrary to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of the whole Church, had need of mighty and evident arguments to evince it.

I expect your demonſtration to prove this; do not think you ſhall gain upon me by ſuch a crafty inſinuation as this is; [being that it cannot but be confeſſed] when nor I, nor any other ſober man ever confeſſed any ſuch thing, much leſſe that this courſe is quite contrary to what is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and commended; when we finde no ſuch courſe extant upon command; and though we allow the thing to be commendable, yet in the places by you cited, we finde no commendation at all given to it. For they are bare rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what was done and no more; and that we do the like may very well be warranted by them; but that by them there is ſuch a neceſſity impoſed, that Scripture may never be read except expounded, you ſhall never prove: or that not to do it, is quite contrary to what is commanded and commended.

               <p>You firſt produce the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.2. <hi>Sonne of man ſpeak to the children of Iſrael, and ſay unto them, when I bring a Sword upon a Land, if the people of the Land take a man of their Coaſts, and ſet him for their Watch-man, &amp;c.</hi> What ſyllable do you here finde of reading firſt a piece of Scripture, and then expounding it? That every Prophet ſent by God is a Watch-man, that it is his duty to acquaint them with the meſſage he hath received from God, and of the danger they are in; if they hear it
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115308:103"/>
not; and of the danger he is in, if he give them not warning: thus much might properly be concluded out of this context; but to your concluſion, I do not diſcerne that this place ſhews the leaſt favourable countenance. For I hope ſuch a Watch-man as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was, a Prophet might ſtand upon his Watch and give warning, without reading any parcel of Scripture before extant, and expounding it to the people. For my part I have alwayes conceived that the Prophets delivered viſions immediately received from God, and that they were not ordinarily Expoſitours of Propheſies or Revelations entruſted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophets. Shew this, and it may evince in part what you intend; In part I ſay, but not in the whole; for you muſt prove that they firſt read, and that they never read any part of the Scripture to the people, but that they expounded it; or elſe you prove nothing.</p>

                  <hi>was read in the ears of all the people,</hi> and yet there I read of no Expoſition.</p>
               <p>Secondly that this in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was done preſently after their return from the Captivity, in which time both the Law and ſenſe might be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and therefore there might be the more reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That they read the Law firſt diſtinctly, before they gave the ſenſe, the neglect of which, is that we complain of; for a Text only is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that preached upon, but the Scripture is ſeldome read or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the example is particular, and except you can prove that it was brought into a rule, ever after to be ſo done, and never otherwiſe, from it you cannot conclude a general, no more then I can out of that practice of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> where I finde it read, and not expounded, conclude that therefore it muſt be read and not expounded.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Were we againſt Expoſitions, you might well produce this practice of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> againſt us; but we like well that after the Chapter read, there follow a ſhort Expoſition. Theſe two then might well like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> live together; <hi>and why then ſhould there be any wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and controverſie between my heard-men and thy heard-m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n about this matter?</hi> Preſſe not your neceſſity, that it muſt be ſo and not otherwiſe, and we have done.</p>
               <p>The third place you alledge, is <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. where we finde <hi>that our Saviour read the Text of the Prophet Iſaiah, and applyed it;</hi> and ſo much liberty ſhall be granted to any Miniſter, if he be able to do it aright. The Text was a Propheſie, and every Propheſie is obſcure, till light by the opening of it be brought to it. This did our Saviour, and this do you, and it ſhall not diſpleaſe. The reading of the Text may be proved from hence, and the lawfulneſſe of a Commentary or Expoſition upon it; but that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which you would enforce, never. This is ſtill to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:115308:103"/>The fourth place, is <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. Which no way proves what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; for there we thus read, <hi>after the reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation to the people, ſay on, then Paul ſtood up — and ſaid, Men and brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Tremellius</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> obſerve upon this place, that firſt in their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues there was the reading of the holy books, that is the Law and the Prophets, which they divided into ſo many Sections, as there were Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths in the year, and to every Section out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> applyed a Section out of ſome Prophet, that was moſt agreeable unto it. Theſe readings then could not be very ſhort, for otherwiſe they could not go through the whole in one year.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe readings being ended, then a Maſter of the Synagogue they had, who gave liberty to preach. Upon which <hi>Aretius</hi> notes, that <hi>Admonemur hic, obſervandum <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It appears not here, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached upon any part of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, that was then read, neither was he moved by the Ruler of the Synagogue to do it, but only to make an exhortation. So that you can never conclude from this place that the Scripture may not be read, except expounded.</p>
               <p>Your laſt place is out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23, 24. which makes leſſe to your purpoſe then any of the reſt; the words are, <hi>If therefore the whole Church be come together in one place, and all ſpeak with tongues, and there come in thoſe that are unlearned, and unbelievers, will he not ſay, that ye are mad? But if all propheſie, and there come in one that believeth no, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in this Chapter ſhews ſome inconveniences that might happen, even upon that gift which then God beſtowed. <hi>viz.</hi> an abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſpeak divers languages. That in this verſe is, that this their confuſed oſtentation of tongues might alienate two ſorts of people, the weaker Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, whom he calls Idiots, and thoſe, who were not yet converted, whom he calls unbeleevers. For put caſe, that any of theſe ſhould come into the Congregation, and hear them ſpeak confuſedly in unknown languages, would he not ſay you were mad? for mad men do uſe to babble that which no man underſtands; but ſober men clear words, which are intelligible. But in Propheſie now there is no ſuch inconvenience to be feared, but the quite contrary profit to be expected. For if it happen that all in the Church Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, that is, out of the Oracles of God, declare his juſtice and wrath againſt ſinne, his mercy toward the penitent; ſhall enlarge themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the true worſhip of God, the obedience and pious life that ought to be in Chriſtians, of ſanctification, of juſtification by Chriſt, of eternal life, a life of joy to the good and believers; of a life of pain to wicked men and Infidels: Theſe or the like being heard from your mouths, Infidels and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men will ſay, God is in you indeed. <hi>i. e.</hi> that you never ſpeak ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115308:104"/>
aptly and wiſely of ſuch divine things, but by aſſiſtance and motion of Gods Spirit.</p>
               <p>This being now the genuine ſenſe of the words, I put it to your ſelf to judge, whether you can any fair way deduce your concluſion from them. That there was then ſuch who did inſtruct the people, and preach unto them all neceſſary points of ſalvation, may eaſily be collected from hence, and that God beſtowed upon them extraordinary abilities to performe that duty. But that Scripture may never be read, except expounded, he that can conclude from hence, I ſhall ſay, that he may as quickly gather that an Ape being like a man in ſomething, therefore he is a man.</p>

                     <p>Romiſh Rites are of two ſorts; either ſuch as are uſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and were of Ancient uſe in other Churches; or ſuch as are meerly Romane, taken up and uſed in the Romiſh Church, after it began to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and was corrupted. All thoſe that are of this kinde we have exploded, not only becauſe there might be ſuperſtition in them, but alſo becauſe they were ſuperfluous, burdonſome, and full of vanity and folly. Thoſe of the firſt kinde, (and ſuch are thoſe of which you ſpeak) becauſe we have found them of perpetual uſe in the Catholick Primitive Church, we yet retain.<note place="margin">Hook.

                        </note> Now whether every Ceremony be to be aboliſhed, becauſe it is in uſe among the Papiſts, be pleaſed to conſult with Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve you that it is not. And indeed if this were not true, we might not kneel and lift up our hands and eyes at our prayers, nor enter reverently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God, nor put our hand on the book when we take an oath, nor ſit in our Pues in the Churches when we hear, nor preach upon any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, becauſe the Papiſts do ſo. Evident then it is that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies are not to be excluded, <hi>quâ</hi> Romiſh, but as they have ſome other vitiouſneſſe adherent to them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Oh but theſe are humane conſtitutions; that may be granted, and yet the Rite nere the worſe, nor the leſſe to be regarded.

                        </note> The diſtinction is your own; there are ſome things eſſential, and ſome things circumſtantial in Religion; what is of the eſſence of it, is immutable, and muſt be preſcribed by the word; but what is circumſtantial is circumſcribed with general limitations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the things themſelves and civil Church cuſtome;

ſo that if there be no errour of man concerning their determination, the determining of them is to be accompted as if it were divine.

                     <p>But now let us go on, and examine <hi>Qui viri,</hi> what kind of men theſe were, who brought theſe Rites into the Church; they were no men of yeſterday, they were not any way infected with the Romane leaven.

by giving the Ring, ſhewed that he had beſtowed honour upon the woman, ſhe every whit as honourable as he was; <hi>ubi ille Cajus, ibi illa Caja.</hi> But then the bed muſt be undefiled, and that it be ſo kept, ſo often as ſhe looks upon her Ring ſhe may well be admoniſhed; for by this pawn given and received, ſhe pledged her faith and fidelity to keep her ſelf onely to one. This will be never done, except their love be endleſſe and continue, of which the Ring is an apt ſymbol, for a circle knows no end.

                     <p>This is a Ceremony at which you are wont to be affrighted, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of old. But you muſt know that this was a Rite uſed in the Church, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages before Popery was heard of. There was a two-fold kinde of Croſſe uſed by them, either tranſient or permanent; the tranſient was made with the motion of the hand, but left no ſigne behind. This was of common practice in the Primitive Church, as appears to any man who hath ever read <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> againſt <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew, and his ſecond Apology; and uſed after Baptiſme, is evident in <hi>Tertullians</hi> Apology, in his book <hi>de Corona Mil, &amp; de reſur. carnis, in Cyprian de lapſis,</hi> and other fathers. But till <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the great carried it with enriched gold and pearls for his Standard, I read not of a permanent Croſſe erected; after his time the erecting of theſe was frequent in all Chriſtian Kingdomes; ſo that the Papiſts were not the Authours of either, but abuſed both. And that the abuſe of any thing ſhould take away the uſe of it, ſeems to me unreaſonable. We have it in no other eſteem than the Ancient Chriſtians; we carry it in our flags, and on our coyne; we glory in it as a Badge of Chriſtianity, we ſigne our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with it after Baptiſme: But to give the ſame honour to it as unto Chriſt; to pray to it, to burn incenſe before it, we utterly reject as ſuperſtitious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and ungodly vanities.

But that you make them Idols is unſufferable; for what is an Idol? it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world, a meer invention and fiction of mans brain ſet up to be an object of adoration; and were theſe brought in for any man to worſhip? what child was ever encouraged to adore his Godfathers and Godmothers? But to make the beſt of it, the calmeſt meaning of this odious word can be but this, that many have given theſe an higher eſtimation than they deſerve. So you have done to many things, to Preaching, to Ruling Elders, to your Combinational Church, to your Miniſterial Pulpit; and yet I know it would ſound very harſh in your ears, if we ſhould fix the name of Idol before them. How would you ſtorme to hear of Idol-preaching, Idol-Elders, Idol-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binational Church, Idol-Miniſterial-Pulpit? And yet there is as much reaſon for the one as the other. For if the eſtimation of any thing beyond that it ought, will preſently make it an Idol, you have made Idols of all theſe, and ſo are equally guilty of Idolatry with us.</p>

is ſufficient to performe what is neceſſary under this Covenant,</hi> Rom. 10.8. Deut. 30.11, 14. <hi>This Covenant I make with thee, but not with thee only, but with thy ſeed.</hi> Now can we but know who was this ſeed, we might eaſily diſcern to whom this Covenant doth extend. In the primary ſenſe thereof it was Chriſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. For this Covenant was made in Chriſt, <hi>ſealed in his blood, and in him made Yea and Amen, verifyed and ratifyed.</hi> Secondly, thy ſeed takes in all men whether Jew or Gentile, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> evidently proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>For Abraham had two kind of ſonnes;</hi> ex carne, <hi>or</hi> ex fide, <hi>of the fleſh, and under the Law, as the Jews,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 4.8, 9.</note> 
                        <hi>of faith and under the regiment of the Spirit, as the Gentiles alſo. For is this bleſſing come on the circumciſion onely, or the uncircumciſion alſo?</hi> For we ſay, that faith was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for righteouſneſſe, and that it was reckoned ſo to him when he was in uncircumciſion, evident it is, that it belonged to the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, as the Apoſtle argues.</p>
                     <p>The Covenant we ſee, and with whom it is made, <hi>Abraham, and with his ſeed the Jew, and to all that are a farre off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, as Saint Peter openeth the promiſe,</hi> Acts 2, 39. Now let us ſee upon what conditions this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> that is expreſſed alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me and be thou perfect,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo required of all his ſeed, if they mean to have benefit by the Covenant. They then are to walk before God in faith and obedience as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and be perfect, not that either can be exact and perfect in this life; but it is required by this Covenant that we become new creatures, renewed in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, honeſt, and faithful obedience to the whole Goſpel. In a word, the condition required of us is faith, hope, charity, ſelf-denial, repentance, a careful and induſtrious husbanding of Gods grace, daily prayer for daily encreaſe, and attending diligently to the means of grace.</p>
                     <p>To ſtrengthen the faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed in the aſſurance of what was promiſed, and for a memorial of what was to be performed, it pleaſed God to have a ſeal ſet in his fleſh, and in the fleſh of his ſeed for that time, which was circumciſion. To this ſeal all the males of the Jews had a right, and this ſeal was cut into them, yea, and as many Proſelytes alſo; who were content to become <hi>proſelytae foederis,</hi> Proſelytes of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The other whom they call'd the Proſelytes of their gates, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred them into the Covenant, and bound them to the obſervation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Commandments of <hi>Noah</hi> by a kinde of purification by water, and the blood of oblation, in the ſame kinde as they admitted their women.</p>
                     <p>The Covenant is the ſelf-ſame under the Goſpel that then God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> on the ſame conditions, of the ſame extent; only it hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſeal; theirs was circumciſion, and ours baptiſme; the cutting of the fleſh gave entrance to them, the waſhing by water gives an entrance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to us.

                     <p>Now this errour, that I call it no worſe, in ſome hath been nouriſhed, in that they have not fully weighed the purport of this diſtinction of the myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and viſible body of Chriſt. This is but one, and we uſually call it the Church, which contains in it two ſorts of people, either outward Profeſſours, or true inward believers. Theſe laſt belong to the myſtical body of Chriſt, which therefore is called myſtical, becauſe the myſtery of their conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is altogether removed from ſenſe; in theſe their love is ſound and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and comes from a pure heart and a good conſcience, and faith unfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and they (no doubt) do and ſhall obtain whatſoever was made over by the ſecond Covenant. Thoſe outward profeſſours, who either before Chriſts coming, or ſince his appearing in the fleſh, have been called by the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115308:107"/>
name of Chriſtians; we call the viſible body, becauſe being Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles they are incorporated into one body; have but one Lord, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants they profeſſe themſelves to be; have one faith, which they all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; one Baptiſme, by which they are all initiated. For although we know the Chriſtian Faith, and allow it, we are then but entring; entred we are not into this viſible Church, till our admittance by the dore of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: and who they are that enter that way, is very well known even to the eye, whence we uſually call theſe the viſible Church, which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if thoſe of the inviſible Church, were not viſible Chriſtians alſo. For both moleties, whether myſtical or viſible, as touching their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, are the object of the eye: eaſie it is for any man to ſay, this man is a Chriſtian, that man a Heathen: But this diſtinction ariſeth from the ſincerity or unſincerity of the profeſſours, becauſe we are never able to ſee and diſcern who they are that ſincerely profeſſe the Truth, therefore we call theſe inviſible; but becauſe we are eaſily able to judge of the men who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Baptiſme, therefore the whole is called a viſible Church. In whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therefore is found the profeſſion of one Lord, one Faith, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, thoſe the Church doth acknowledge for her children; and all thoſe none of hers in whom they are not found: as Jews, Turks, Heathens, &amp;c. Others for their external profeſſion are Chriſtians, and are of the viſible Church of Chriſt. And among theſe there are ſome who profeſſe the Truth, but not wholly and entirely, and theſe are Hereticks; ſome that profeſſe the whole ſaving Truth, but not in unity, and theſe are Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; ſome that profeſſe the whole ſaving Truth in unity, but not in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſanctity, and theſe are hypocrites and profane perſons; others that profeſſe the whole ſaving Truth in unity and ſincerity of a good and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed life, and theſe are true beleevers and good Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>Yet Chriſtians by external profeſſion thoſe all are; who carry that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal mark I now named, yea, although they be impious Idolaters, wicked Hereticks, Schiſmaticks, Hypocrites, profane perſons, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, yea, and caſt out for notorious improbity. For they are but ſo caſt out, that they may be taken again upon their repentance, and that without the ſetting the ſeal anew; which might not be done, if they had been utterly caſt off. There is but one way onely, after a man is entred by Baptiſme, that can make him forfeit his whole eſtate in Church ſociety, and that is a general revolt and Apoſtacy from his Chriſtian profeſſion, as turning Turk, Jew or Infidel.</p>
                     <p>All theſe, except the ſincere profeſſours, we deny not, may be the Imps and Limbs of Satan, even as long as they continue ſuch; is it then poſſible for the ſelf-ſame men to be the Synagogue of Satan, and to be the Church of Jeſus Chriſt? unto that Church which is his myſtical body, it is not poſſible, becauſe that body conſiſteth of none but true Iſraelites, true ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> true ſervants and Saints of God. Howbeit that they be true and real, and not equivocal Members of the outward viſible body, it is very poſſible, notwithſtanding the unſincerity of their profeſſion, and the wickedneſſe of their converſation, which is worthily both hateful in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115308:108"/>
eyes of God himſelf, and in the eyes of the ſounder part of the viſible Church moſt execrable.</p>
                     <p>If you doubt of the truth of this, remember the Parables of <hi>the Corne Field, the Net, the ten Virgins, the Barn-floor, the houſe in which were veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour and diſhonour.</hi> And if theſe ſatisfie not, then look upon thoſe two plain Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>There are ſcandalous perſons enumerated, a Fornicatour, Covetous, a Drunkard,</hi> yet within, that is, within the Church and Covenant, yet a brother of the viſible ſociety for all that; and indeed except he be looked upon as a brother, and as within, how could he be caſt out by excommunication? for what have we to do to judge thoſe who are without? The other place, is 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Among whom there was a diſorderly perſon, yet he was not to be counted as an enemy, not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as one out of the Church, an Unbeliever, an Heathen, but to be admoniſhed as a brother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For lack of diligent obſerving this difference, firſt, betwixt the Church of God, myſtical and viſible; then betwixt the viſible ſound and corrupted, corrupted ſometimes more, ſometimes leſſe; Thirdly, in not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of the latitude of the Covenant which belongs to the viſible Church, as <hi>a proprium quarto modo;</hi> i. e. as an eſſential mark, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights are not few nor light that have been committed. To paſſe by others, you, becauſe Chriſts true body is made up of none but ſincere profeſſours, preſently conclude, that none but ſincere profeſſours are of Chriſts body, which is true of the myſtical, but not of the viſible. Then you reſtraine the Covenant, as if it belonged to none but the Elect, whereas it belongs to all thoſe to whom God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, I will be to the a God, and thy ſeed after thee, whether ſonnes</hi> ex lege, <hi>or</hi> ex fide. Thirdly, whereas the Covenant was made with the Catholick viſible Church, you reſtrain it to your Combinational; ſo that they who are not Members of that, ſhall have no right to the ſeals; nor to it, not any other ſhall they claim any right at all, who are not regenerate, whereas this diſtinction obſerved, would ſet you right. We muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the effectual benefits of Chriſt, held forth in the Ordinance, and a right to the external Ordinance. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer right and priviledge belongs only indeed to the regenerate; for they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly effectually to life receive the ſeals. But the latter to all within the Church, to all Church Members, for a night they have to the external Ordinance. Or you may if you pleaſe conceive it thus. The Sacrament may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> that is, with the entire fruits and benefits of the Covenant, unto which truth of grace and faith is neceſſarily required, and ſo to the Reprobate the Sacrament belongs not; or elſe <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely in the Ordinance it ſelf, abſtracted from thoſe graces, and ſo it is Church-memberſhip alone, or external Covenant-relation, denominating men, ſubjects, ſonnes, Saints, believers, diſciples, brethren; Chriſtians, that gives men right unto the ſeal. Fifthly, You over-haſtily and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably cenſure all Hereticks, Papiſts, wicked perſons, and excommunicable, or excommunicate to be without the Covenant; and that therefore if they be Parents of children, the applying of publick or private Baptiſme to their
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115308:108"/>
children is groundleſſe. Which miſtake of yours how great it is, I ſhall make it farther appear by theſe evident arguments.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That which is unjuſt may not be done; but to debarre a Chriſtians child from the ſeal of the Covenant is unjuſt; therefore it may not be done.</hi> Minor probatur.</p>

                     <p>That all who come to be fed and phyſick'd at the Lords Supper, were Chriſts faithful friends and followers, is as much deſired by us, as can be by you; and as much endeavoured by us, as can be by you. Why is it elſe that the Church hath prefixed thoſe ſeveral exhortations before the Communion, in which the negligent are checked and excited to their duty, the preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſcandalous and obſtinate ſinners preſented with their danger and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they approach unworthily in their ſinnes, all that come exhorted to judge themſelves, to repent them truly of their ſinnes paſt, and amend their lives; To have a lively and ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt our Saviour; to be in perfect charity with all men, and above all things to give humble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Sonne, and Holy Ghoſt, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, by the death and paſſion of his Sonne, and for the inſtitution and ordination of the holy myſteries? What rules can you give beyond theſe? or what cautions can you preſcribe, that if obſerved, can make men worthy communicants?</p>
                     <p>All this you will eaſily grant, but of all this you will have a certain knowledge before you admit of any, and that knowledge ſhall be grounded upon their conjunction with your Combinational Church, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then entred, not with the Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham;</hi> So that uncharitably you exclude all thoſe who have right unto the ſeal by the tenour of Gods Covenant, except he have a new acquired right ariſing from your Covenant alſo. Theſe I know you mean by Chriſts faithful friends and followers, and none but theſe your practice ſhews you would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>That then the miſts may be diſpelled, and the miſtakes recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that have prevailed too farre about the admiſſion to, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Lords Table, neceſſary it is, that we diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the right which any man hath to this ſeale, and the uſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115308:110"/>
that a man may make of his right, and how he may be debarred of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The right that any man hath to this or any other Ordinance of God, ariſeth out of the Covenant of God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Humphryes.</hi>
                        </note> that is, with the viſible Church; ſo that every one that is admitted a Member of the Church viſible, hath a right to this and all other Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For it is Memberſhip alone that gives right, ſo that though a perſon be unregenerate, an infant, diſtracted, ignorant, or ſcandalous, if he be a Member of the viſible Church, he hath a right to the Ordinance, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right being the ſame in one as in the other.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now in the uſe of this right, the difference eſpecially lies betwixt us. We acknowledge that infants and diſtracted perſons may not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this uſe of the ſeal, the Lords Supper, not for any want of right, as appears invincibly by the other Sacrament, to the uſe of which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, becauſe capable: But not to this, becauſe of their incapacity natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as in children, accidental as in mad men. For it is required of every one that comes to the Lords Table, that he examine his knowledge, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, charity, and be able to diſcern the Lords Body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither infants nor diſtracted perſons can do; therefore we debar them juſtly from the uſe of their right; <hi>No otherwiſe then a child though he be heir of all, yet is not to be admitted to the uſe of his inheritance, while he is thought fit to be under a Tutour or Governour.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That which we ſay of infants and ignorants, the ſelf-ſame you would have applyed to the unregenerate, ignorant and ſcandalous, ſo that none of theſe ſhould be admitted to the Sacrament. Firſt, for the unregenerate you have ſet your ſelves a very hard task; for how is it poſſible for you or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man elſe with the judgment of faith to be aſſured that any man is ſo? re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation lies deeper than the eye of man can diſcern. If it be but upon the judgment of charity, then it is but hope and ſuſpition, and upon that accompt you may admit the ignorant and profane alſo, hoping and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably preſuming, that they have knowledge and repentance enough; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would not preſume to preſent themſelves at this Feaſt; want of regeneration is then no ſufficient Barre to exclude a man from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if irregeneration will not do it, yet ignorance may. But here again you have undertaken another hard task; for I ſhall here ask you, how much knowledge is preciſely requiſite in a Communicant before he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requires no more but that he diſcern the Lords body; know that it is no common bread, and common wine, but one repreſents Chriſts Body broken, the other his blood ſhed for the redemption of the world; and that he examine himſelf, about which the Church hath ſet him a plain way in the laſt anſwer of the Chatechiſmes; And ſo ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>let him eat.</hi> So much knowledge as this I ſee not, but eaſily may be, and I verily believe is in moſt Communicants. And if it were but confuſed before he came, yet it might be there more diſtinctly taught him, by what he there hears, and ſees done. The Sacrament through the Word is a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

                     <p n="3">3. As touching the profane and ſcandalous in the next place, no man can be more unwilling that they ſhould be admitted then my ſelf. But I ſhall not allow every man to be a judge of profaneſſe and ſcandal. True it is, that every ſinner approaching this holy Table in his ſinne and profaneſs eats unworthily, and ruines himſelf. Again, it is true that the Governours of the Church, when they know any man goes on ſcandalouſly and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently in any ſinne, ought to inflict the Church cenſures upon him, and withdraw the Sacrament even in charity to his ſoul. In reſpect of the firſt, the Miniſter is to do what lies in him, to diſſwade the prophane man to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, leſt that by coming and eating unworthily he do himſelf a miſchief; and if in prudence he refuſe him, I am not againſt it. In reſpect of the ſecond, the Governours are to do their duty, who alone becauſe the Keyes are in their hands, have power to debarre men from the uſe of their right.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Becauſe excluſion from the Sacrament is not to be allowed upon thoſe reaſons which are moſt ſtood upon. 1. Not becauſe the men are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be unregenerate. 2. Not from the nature of the Ordinance it ſelf as diſtinct from others. 3. Not becauſe you may not give holy things to dogs. 4. Not becauſe there is a pollution feared, which the pure may contract from the profane. All theſe reaſons are very weak, and therefore none upon theſe reaſons to be excluded. I ſhall ſay a little to every one of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The irregenerate conditon in which the receiver may be conceived to be, is of no validity, as I have formerly proved from the nature of the Covenant made and ſealed to the whole ſeed, <hi>ex carne.</hi> I ſhall only adde this, that Chriſt who well knew that <hi>Judas</hi> even at that very time, when he was in full reſolution to betray him, yet admitted him to the Sacrament, and adminiſtred it. And could any man be more carnal and unregenerate? To be unregenerate then is no good reaſon.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. No nor that great reverence which is to be given to the Sacrament, as if the Sacrament were to be advanced above all other Ordinances and parts of Gods worſhip. For though this be <hi>tremendum myſterium;</hi> yet the ſame qualities are required to effectual prayer, hearing of the Word as to the Sacrament; and therefore the defect thereof ſhould as well exclude a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane man from thoſe, as from this, which I know you will not ſay, in that you admit theſe to your prayer and Sermon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Much leſſe from that often alledged Text, <hi>Give not that which is holy to dogs,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mat. 7.6.</note> 
                        <hi>nor caſt your pearls before ſwine, &amp;c.</hi> For holy things are all thoſe things which are ſubſervient to holy uſes; wholeſome Scripture Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, pious Conferences, precious ſayings, advice, actions, &amp;c. as well as Ordinances; theſe no wiſe man will caſt before dogs and ſwine; But what before no dogs and ſwine? <hi>i. e.</hi> no ignorant and ſcandalous ſinners? No, that cannot be our Saviours intention, becauſe the word, and wholeſome admonition is to be uſed to theſe. But before ſuch dogs and ſwine that the Text deſcribes, theſe pearls are not to be caſt, to wit, ſuch as will crample the holy things under their feet, ſuch which will turn again and rent us, ſuch
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115308:111"/>
ſwine, to whom there is no neceſſity that calls upon us to do it. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then of our Saviours counſel is, that in the managing of ſpiritual things we be prudent, and have regard to the perſons to whom we diſpenſe them; that we forbear when we ſhall exaſperate them, and gain but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to our own hurt; as 'tis but in vain to give good counſel, or reprove a man when he is in a paſſion; a dogged humour to watch an opportunity doth far better.</p>
                     <p>Now thoſe whom you ſuppoſe to be dogs and ſwine, are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; though profane and ſcandalous perſons, yet we are ſure they are not contumacious, becauſe they come to us, and deſire the Sacrament at our hands; we are ſure they will not turn again upon us, and rent us for that; ſure we are, they are no ſwine that will trample upon it, neglect, vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, deſpiſe or reject it, but ſo far as we can poſſibly conjecture, do reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently receive it. And ſo from this Text we finde no ground why we in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhould not adminiſter the Sacrament unto them; nay, we find much in it that may perſwade us unto it. For ſay now we with-hold the Sacrament from them, they in fury, when they hear we reckon them no better than dogs and ſwine, may grow dogged and hoggiſh unto us, turn upon us and rend us, and trample upon the Sacrament as no pearl. Conſider but what effect the Bulls of <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had upon the ſtate of <hi>Venice;</hi> or thoſe thunderbolts of the Pope againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and tell me whether I ſay not true; loth I am to ſay it, but truth compels me; your rigidneſſe and want of charity in regiſtring many good and pious Chriſtians, in the black brutiſh book of dogs and hogs, hath alienated from you more minds than you will eaſily recover.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But then after all this, upon the admiſſion of prophane and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous perſons, there is a pollution to be feared. Whence we are to put in practice ſuch directions as theſe; <hi>Purge out the old leaven, put away from your ſelves that wicked perſon; avoid, withdraw from them, keep no company with ſuch, no not to eat. Let him be to thee as an Heathen and a Publican.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7, 13, 9, 11. Matth. 18.</note> All theſe precepts at firſt ſight, ſeem very favourable for an ejection or not admiſſion of profane perſons; but on a ſerious view, it will appear that they are not concluding for what they are brought. For if there be any pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution by this mixt communion, it muſt either adhere to the Sacrament, or Admitters, or Communicants. To the Sacrament it cannot adhere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the ſavour of life unto life to every worthy receiver, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſuppoſed pollution in the receiver; for I hope the Sacramental eſſence was not polluted, and conſequently an unholy Ceremony to the reſt of the Apoſtles, though <hi>Judas</hi> was preſent at it, and received it with them. To the Admitters this pollution cannot adhere, becauſe they do but their duty; for they are bound to maintain every mans right, and further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man in the uſe of his right, ſo long as he is not debarred of it. Now that a moral uncleanneſſe is no bar, is proved before. The rule is, when an action hath evil in its own ſubſtance, it is to be omitted; but when the action of it ſelf is the matter of a precept, and hath evil externally caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by the Agent that doth it, here the action is not to be omitted, but the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115308:112"/>
Agent reformed. I explain my meaning, and apply the rule thus. This action of Adminiſtration of the Sacrament hath no evil in it in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; had it ſo, it were to be omitted; 'tis a matter of a precept, and muſt therefore be done: Say, that had evil been caſt upon it externally by ſome unworthineſſe of the receiver, yet the action is not to be omitted, but the receiver to be reformed. 3. Neither is this pollution conveyed over to the Communicants; for all uncleanneſſe that is contracted by anothers ſin, is either from counſel, aſſiſtance, defence or imitation; now what worthy Communicant is guilty of any of theſe wayes? Did ever any Miniſter or Communicant encourage or counſel a ſcandalous or profane perſon to come to the Lords Table in his ſin? was he ever any aſſiſtant to him in it? did he defend that it was to be done? nay, the contrary is apparent, as appears in the Liturgy, where the Miniſter exhorts, Therefore if any of you be a blaſphemer of God, a hinderer or ſlanderer of his Word, an Adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, bewail your ſinne, and come not to this holy Table, &amp;c. and in charity he is bound to believe (ſeeing he cannot ſearch the heart) that he, who after this admonition comes, is a true penitent.</p>
                     <p>And therefore from hence there can ariſe no pollution. 'Tis poſſible indeed evil company may draw to an imitation of ſinne and ſo pollute. But if not ſo, (for I know no good man will therefore be profane, becauſe a profane man is admitted to the Sacrament) the very keeping company with them in theſe ſacred meetings, is far from being a ſin. It is only a clear acknowledgment that they are of the number of the redeemed, <hi>whereof yet ſome are damned;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> then that they joyne with them in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, which certainly I may do with all Profeſſours; laſtly, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federating in vow to live a Chriſtian and ſincere life, and that I may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do in the company of them that are not ſincere.

                     <hi>YEt the meer ſight of a Monarchical Pue to ſtand in the ſtead of a Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Pulpit, is a strong plea of a ſtrange Apoſtacy from the commendable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the primitive Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your adverſative particle Yet made me ſtart; for I muſt tell you that I underſtand ſo much in act, that when it follows any long conceſſion, as it doth in this place, it intimates that all things were light that went before, in compariſon of that which followeth; he being but little verſed in the Art of Rhetorick, who will grant to his Adverſary any thing of which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make his advantage. This then that you here mention muſt be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abomination than any one, or indeed all the particulars you before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or elſe your Yet was not conſiderately placed. What, the juſtling out a Pulpit, and placing a Pue inſtead of it, a greater offence, than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting profane perſons to the Lords Table? what, this a ſtronger plea of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy, than the Common ſervice book? what is it to tithe mint and anniſe, and cummin, and to let paſſe the great and weightier matters of the Law, if this be not it? doth God take care for Oxen? is he pleaſed or diſpleaſed with Pues, with Pulpits, with Elders ſeats? No queſtion, it is all one with him, in what part of the Church, or by whom they are ſet. 'Tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man of the heart that he looks upon; as for theſe outward accoutrements of his ſervice, he hath entruſted to the hands and heads of diſcreet men. And methinks you of all others ſhould leaſt inſiſt upon them, who are ſo great enemies to all outward worſhip, or what may be ordained by men for the decency and order of that worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Farther, I think you have miſplaced your Epithites, and beſtowed them on wrong ſubjects; for it were far truer to ſay the Monarchical Pulpit, and the Miniſterial Pue: for whatſoever was done in the Pue, was but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſterial; but ſince you have invaded and ingroſſed the Pulpit, you thence dictate and dogmatize like the violent Monarch you before named. Thence you damne whomſoever you pleaſe. I have heard this black ſentence thence pronounced, that all the old Clergy are frying in an iron grate in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115308:113"/>
hell; that they that wil not come to hear you, do tread under foot the blood of the Son of God; and make a mock of him; and thence again you ſave whom you pleaſe, as if all the Legiſlative power were in your hands; what you deliver from thence, be it never ſo crude and indigeſted ſtuff, you call the Goſpel of the Kingdome, the very Word of God.<note place="margin">News from <hi>Ipſwich. Apologiſta. c.</hi> 3.</note> A man would think you were inclining very far to that opinion of the Apologiſt for the Jeſuites, who ſaith, <hi>jungantur in unum, dies cum nocte, tenebrae cum luce, calidum cum frigido, ſanitas cum morbo, vita cum morte, &amp; erit tum ſpes aliqua poſſe in caput Jeſuitae haereſin cadere.</hi> I ever took Sermons and ſo do ſtill, to be moſt neceſſary expoſitions and applications of the holy Scripture, and a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of ſaving knowledge, but I cannot think them or the Preachers of them out of a Pulpit divinely infallible; And it may be obſerved too, that no men are more apt to ſay then they, that all the Fathers were but men, and might erre; and if then they be not tranſcended the condition of men, when they are aſcended the Pulpit, poſſible it is that they may erre too.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, what an Idol (pardon the word, it is from your own ſhop, when you call the Liturgy Idol-ſervice, and the ſureties in Baptiſme Idol Godfathers) have they made of the Pulpit, ever ſince from thence they diſpenſe all their Adminiſtrations. The child to be baptized by the Miniſter in the Pulpit; the Sacrament to be ſent by the hand of the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to all the Congregation out of the Pulpit: The Word and all the prayer then uſed out of the Pulpit; and whether the cenſures be to be pronounced out of the Pulpit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bayly pag.</hi> 121.122.</note> I yet know not. So that if there were any ſenſe at all to be collected out of this word <hi>[Monarchical,]</hi> I ſhould rather attribute it to the Pulpit, than to the Pue, which I am ſure was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver guilty of any Monarchy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And ſince we are entred into a compariſon of the Pue and Pulpit; I ſhall adde one conſideration more, which I profeſſe to you I do very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, it having been known to you and others, that I have been as indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in the Pulpit, as any other in the Pue. The Pue and Pulpit are in themſelves inanimate things, wood and ſtone; no prerogative can accrue to either from them; if there be any priority, it muſt be from the actions that were performed from thence. In the Pue we had the Liturgy of the Church celebrated, in the other the Word of God explained, and preſſed on the conſcience for practce by the tongues of men; if then I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for any priviledge of either, I ſhould give it to the Pue, becauſe in that was celebrated <hi>cultus ipſe,</hi> which is the prayers; in the other is held forth no more but <hi>doctrina cultus,</hi> a doctrine which teacheth us to worſhip God; in the one there is exerciſed only <hi>actus imperatus,</hi> a command is only laid upon us, do this; but in the other there is <hi>actus elicitus;</hi> for we chooſe to practice what we have been taught, which how far it is more acceptable than bare preaching, and teaching, and hearing, read our Saviours words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23.</p>
                  <p>As for Sermons, I hope men do not undertake to prove, that they are as eminent a part of Gods worſhip as prayer. If they do, I muſt leſſe blame the poor ignorant people, that think when they have heard a Sermon or two,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115308:114"/>
that they have ſerved God for that day, or that week; nor the generality of thoſe ſeduced ones, who place ſo great piety in hearing, and think ſo much the more comfortably of themſelves for the number of hours ſpent in that exerciſe, which of late hath been made the main Church-buſineſſe, and yet is no more than may be done by a Heathen or profane perſon. I ſhall think him to ſerve God beſt, that devoutly prayes moſt, and comes oftneſt, and falls down and kneels, and worſhips before the Lord his Maker. It cannot be thought equal, that prayer and preaching ſhould be ſo unwarily placed in competition, as that prayer ſhould loſe by the compariſon. There may be alwayes need of preaching, but then moſt of all, when the Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is unchriſtian. This reaſon prevailed very much in the Primitive times, when it was but in vain and unprofitable to go about to convert the world no otherwiſe than by our prayers. Yet even in thoſe Primitive times, which had moſt cauſe to call for preaching, we ſhall finde that this duty was of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer exerciſe, and leſſe ſolemnity than that of prayer, as it may abundantly be diſcovered by the Liturgies of both Churches yet extant.<note place="margin">Maimonid.

                  <p>By this I have ſaid it is not my purpoſe to detract any thing from preaching, but conſidering the age we live in, that we ſhould ſo far mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our opinion of the Pulpit, that we diſdain not the Pue, that we beware leſt by magnifying preaching, we bring not diſcredit and diſadvantage upon neceſſary prayer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, whereas you ſay that this Pue juſtled out the Pulpit that was erected by the Primitive Chriſtians; I beleeve you would be very hard put to it to prove, that then there was either Pue or Pulpit in any common uſe among them, for how could it be, when Temples and Churches were thinly erected? the greateſt part of Chriſtians under the tenne bloody perſecutions, meeting where they could, and ſometimes in Caves and Grots to ſerve God.

Or ſay, that all you charge us withal had been done, the Pue ſet up in the Pulpits place, will this prove that this had been a ſtrong plea of a ſtrange Apoſtaſie from the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians? I have alwayes thought that Apoſtacy had lyen in doctrine or in manners; in either of theſe, when men degenerate, they may in ſome ſenſe be called Apoſtates; but if they ſhall change a Pue into a Pulpit, or a Pulpit into a Pue, to lay to their charge Apoſtacy for this, is what I never heard before, and am confident I ſhall never hear again.

                     <p>What's this I read here? moral equity, and the conſequent upon it, perpetual obſervation? If you would have ſtudied for an Axiome to undo your own cauſe, you could not have found out ſuch another. I wonder why we contend all this while about Rites, Ceremonies, indifferent things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for decency and order in the Church, where the governours of the Church, as is proved before out of your New-<hi>Englands</hi> conſtitutions, might ordain them to thoſe ends. Now it is but moral equity that in all lawful things we obey our Superiours, and conſequently of perpetual obſervation. Talk no more then hereafter of a Surplice, of Banes, of a Ring, of a Pue, of a Pulpit, and ſuch trifles; for equity and morality require that they be obſerved: Arraign us for obſervation of Rites and Ceremonies; moral equity is our Tutour, and hath taught us to embrace them.

                     <p>Theſe words I underſtand not well, becauſe I know not your practice; but if it be conſonant to the ſound of theſe lines, I finde a very deep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement lyes upon the Elders; for what, are they <hi>ex officio</hi> bound to begin and end all the publick Ordinances, to tranſact all the open concernments of the City of God? This is a very high charge and a large power; for the Ordinances of the City of God are the diſpenſations of the Word, the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Impoſition of hands, the application of the Power of the Keys, with all the other acceſſories and circumſtantials to theſe. Were your words true, then no Sermon muſt be begun or ended, no prayer begun or ended, and the like is to be ſaid of all the reſt, nothing of them or about them, begun, tranſacted or ended, but by their advice and deciſion. Of which there is not one ſyllable that I beleeve, and therefore for ſuch a claim, it behoved you to produce a very fair and clear Charter; for elſe all thoſe that bear no good will to your Diſcipline and Combination, will endite you for incroachment and uſurpation of anothers right. Which aſperſion you will never be able to get off, by telling us barely on your word, this is the Elders power. Nor by affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>

The Anabaptiſt to prove his Antipaedobaptiſme, hath often in his mouth theſe words, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new light this Oggannition, <hi>all muſt be done according to the pattern in the Mount;</hi> and that we may take the more notice of it, as a firme argument for your Elders ſeats and proceedings, you have cited here three Scriptures, one upon the neck of another for it, all which, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dreams are but one. The occaſion of theſe words are in <hi>Exodus</hi> 25. <hi>When God gave order to Moſes for the erecting of the Tabernacle, about which God left him not to his own choice, but commanded him to frame it according to the pattern ſhewed him in the Mount:</hi> This Tabernacle and order Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> mentions, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Heb. 8.5. opens the myſtery and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it: to wit, <hi>that the Tabernacle of Moſes was but a ſhadow and exemplar of heavenly things, or of that Tabernacle which Chriſt had ſet up for his in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Here then are to be conſidered three diſtinct things, the body it ſelf, the reality, or truth of this ſhadow, and that is the true Tabernacle of the Saints in heaven. The <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or type of it, that was preſented for a pattern to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount, and the exemplar or picture or copy of it fair drawn by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Tabernacle, which he is commanded to frame according to the pattern preſented to his eyes, when God was pleaſed to call him up to him into the Mountain; which things he alſo after did.</p>
                     <p>Now I wonder what you or any body elſe, can for your purpoſe collect from hence. <hi>Moſes</hi> was commanded to make the Tabernacle according to the pattern in the Mount; therefore the Lay-Elders are plainly warranted, and punctually preſcribed to ſtand and ſit together in the face and full view of the Aſſembly. A ſtrange thing it is, that out of a particular pattern you ſhould frame a general rule. For before you ſhall be ever able to bring this rule home to your purpoſe, prove you muſt that it was
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115308:116"/>
thus preſcribed in the Mount, which I know will be a very hard task.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, ſuppoſe you extend the rule further, as I know you do, to beat down that which you ordinarily call will-worſhip, and the inventions of men: Yet ſo it will not come home neither, in that the Apoſtle applies it not to any ſuch purpoſe; but only what was done in the Mount, was a ſhadow of things to come; the Tabernacle on earth, a repreſentation of our being with God in heaven. And to ſtretch it further, is to deal by it as the Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler doth with his leather, that tugs it ſo far with his teeth till it crack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p>Farther yet, if in that ſenſe you intend it, this Text had laid an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon any, it had certainly tyed up the Jewes; the pattern in the Mount, muſt certainly have reſtrained them from adding any thing even the leaſt in the external worſhip of God, which yet it did not. For in the Church of the Jews it muſt be granted that the appointment of the houre for daily ſacrifices, the building of Synagogues throughout the Land to hear the Word of God and pray in, when they came not up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the erecting of Pulpits and Chairs to teach in; the order of Burials and Rites of Marriage; the Muſical Inſtruments invented by <hi>David;</hi> the Ordinance for Prieſts to ſerve in their courſes, with others of the like nature, being matters appertaining to the Church, yet had not their pattern from the Mount, nor are any way preſcribed in the Law, but were by the Churches diſcretion inſtituted and continued. What, ſhall we then think they did hereby adde to the Law, and ſo diſpleaſe God by what they did? none yet ſo hardly perſwaded of them; the Truth is that Rule and Canon-Law which is written in all mens hearts, and Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> reduced into precept, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order,</hi> doth clear them from doing any thing in theſe and the like, that was amiſſe; neither do we finde that God or any Prophet ever reproved them for theſe Acceſſories taken up without a pattern in the Mount. Seeing therefore Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule binds by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of nature, which the Jews obſerving as yet unwritten, and thereby framing ſuch Church-Orders as in their Law were not preſcribed, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in that reſpect unculpable: It followeth that many things may be lawfully done in the Church, ſo as they be not done againſt the Scripture, although no Scripture do command them, but the Church only following the light of reaſon, judge them in diſcretion to be meet.</p>
                     <p>And in effect, they who firſt oppoſed, ſeemed to grant ſo much; For this <hi>Cartwright</hi> gave forth, that nothing ought to be eſtabliſhed in the Church which is not commanded in the Word, if not by ſpecial precepts,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.32. 1 Cor. 14.40. 1 Cor. 14.26. Rom. 14.6, 7.</note> yet by general rules; which are nothing ſcandalous and offenſive; <hi>All things in order and ſeemlineſſe; All unto aedification; All to the glory of God.</hi> So then theſe Rules being obſerved, all things in the Church may be appointed, not only not againſt, but by and according to the Word of God. By this large conceſſion for ought I ſee, even that which they oppoſe may be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the pattern in the Mount. And if you had intended utterly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the uſe of rectifyed reaſon and prudence in ordering any thing in Gods
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115308:117"/>
houſe, why did you but now ſay that it is of moral equity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of perpetual obſervation, that a rightly Reformed Church ſhould have all her Elders ſtand and ſit together, in the face and full view of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; in reaſon and prudence, I grant you may finde ſomewhat to perſwade it, but ſearch as long as you will for a pattern in the Mount for it, and it will not be found; for what you in the following words alledge, are but meer colours, as I will make it plainly appear.</p>

                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:115308:118"/>That there was a Presbytery in the Apoſtolical times I have formerly proved, but that it conſiſted of Lay-Elders it lies upon you to make good, before you can derive their Commiſſion from this place. Secondly, <hi>Jerome, Primaſius, Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> tell us that by Presbytery the function is meant, and not the Colledge, and then the place will ſtand you in no ſtead; and that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> is uſed for Presbyter, I could ſhew you if I liſt by more than ten teſtimonies of the Greek Fathers and Councels. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophilact,</hi> inform us that <hi>Paul</hi> by the Presbytery meant the Biſhops; for a meer Presbyter might not impoſe hands on a Biſhop. <hi>Neque enim fas erat, aut licebat,</hi>

                        <hi>ut inferior ordinaret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joreme, nemo enim tribuit quod non accepit.</hi> Fourthly, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf teſtifyeth that he laid hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> ſtrongly preſſeth. Laſtly, granted it muſt be that <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Evangeliſt, which function the Presbytery of no particular Church could give him by your tenets. This place then being ſet aſide, I finde not any other that can carry ſo much as a colour for the Commiſſion you ſpeak of; and that from this they can claim no power, I have partly made good here, and more fully before, and therefore I ſay the leſſe of it.</p>
                     <p>One thing only I ſhall adde, that the Latine Fathers expound it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractly; <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie the Office of Prieſt-hood, that is, neglect not the grace of the Presbyterate, that is in thee, by the impoſition of hands; and this <hi>Eraſmus</hi> helps, by making <hi>Presbyterii</hi> to depend upon <hi>gratiam, in regimine;</hi> reading it thus, <hi>noli negligere gratiam Presbyterii, quae data est, — per manuum impoſitionem,</hi> and ſuch trajections are no new things in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>To thoſe places you cite out of the <hi>Revelation</hi> I have anſwered before, and ſhewed that they concern not at all your Elders, and therefore I ſhall not need to ſay any more to them.</p>

                     <p>This is the recapitulation of the whole, which I have ſhewed partly not ſubject to ſo harſh a cenſure, partly built upon a weak foundation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ll need to ſay the leſſe to it. Yet becauſe I may not leave you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied in the leaſt, I ſhall give you ſome ſhort animadverſions upon this alſo.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You here ſet down your whole plat-form, ſhaping it into the faſhion of a natural body, which hath eſſential and integral parts; and till the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial be ſo qualifyed, you afford it no mercy, nor hope of ſolid peace.</p>
                     <p>Your conſtitution of a Church I allow of, both in the eſſentials and the integrals; for 'tis a body, and muſt be ſo compoſed; and when organical, if perfect, it muſt be intire. In the General then I ſhall agree
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115308:119"/>
with you, but in the ſpecial aſſignation of your parts will lie the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                     <p>For what Church is there of what Sect ſoever, that doth diſſent in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms from this aſſigned and neceſſary conſtitution, that you may know that it is no ſpecial Character of your Combinational, or as you call it here the Presbyterial Church? The Browniſts, Barrowiſts, Anabaptiſts, Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, Socinians, Epiſcopal men, will allow you viſible men for your matter, a Covenant for the form, and Church-Officers for the integral parts of your organical body.</p>
                     <p>And for your matter, the Browniſts, Barrowiſts, Anabaptiſts, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians will agree with you, that they muſt be viſible Converts, meaning thereby a company of faithful people, every one whereof in the face of the whole Congregation hath given ſo clear tokens of true grace and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as hath ſatisfyed the minds of all. This is to be proved by you; for Epiſcopal men with the Presbyters require no more of viſible members, than that they profeſſe one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme, as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for all that carry the name of Chriſtians, whether in ſincerity or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they reckon in the boſome of the Church, as in the type the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> there were clean and unclean Beaſts, in the net good and bad fiſh. <hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphyra, Simon Magus, Demas,</hi> &amp;c. among the baptized.</p>
                     <p>In your form alſo the explicite Covenant, the four fore-named will agree with you; for your doctrine is, that this company muſt be incorporate by Oath and Covenant to exerciſe all the parts of Chriſtian Religion in one place under one Paſtour, to which they wll admit no more people then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly may with their eaſe convene in one meeting houſe. This is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be proved by you; but how weakly, I ſhall make it appear, when I come to examine your texts you alledge for it.</p>
                     <p>The Presbyters, though they like not your engagement, yet came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what near to it in impoſing their ſolemn League and Covenant upon the conſciences of many tender ſouls, who choſe rather to be undone then to yield to their incroachment; and how pleaſing this was to God, you may judge by the ſucceſſe, which is your own common argument. Now for the Epiſcopal men, they admit of a Covenant alſo; but that is Baptiſme, which they ſay is the Sacrament of Admiſſion into the Viſible Church; and this I have proved to be ſufficient; and another Covenant more than needs.</p>
                     <p>In the enumeration of your integral parts, your Teacher, your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, your Rulers, your Deacons, your Widows for the general, I know not any man that will gain-ſay you, and ſome of your Texts do well prove it. But in the Miſnomer of theſe, and their abſolute neceſſity there is not a full agreement. For Mr. <hi>Cann</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> thought his Church ſound e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough when in his Church there was but one Paſtour,<note place="margin">Bayly pag. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> and could not agree till very lately of any other Officer; and in the year 1645. they lived without an Elderſhip, as they did before without a Paſtour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:115308:120"/>And firſt touching your Teachers and Paſtours, I have before ſhewed you that it is not neceſſary that they be diſtinct perſons, both the duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſible to be performed by one man, as it fell out at <hi>Geneva,</hi> where <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> men of great abilities thought they might, and did ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply both places both of Teacher and Paſtour; and your reaſon you here give, and your practice alſo confirms me in it. For your Teacher you ſay muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe the word of knowledge and information to the judgment; and the Paſtour the word of wiſdome and exhortation to the will and affections: Pray tell me what ſhould hinder that one and the ſame man may not teach and inform the judgment, and make wiſe to ſalvation, exhort and move the will and affections in the ſame houre? Were it otherwiſe, you your ſelf preach by a wrong method, who explain and apply, who raiſe a Doctrine out of your Text, by which you inform the underſtanding, and then labour to apply it, and make it uſeful to the will and affections of your Auditors. Tye up your Teacher to theſe ſtrict terms, and he ſhall only ſtudy poſitive Divinity, and your Paſtour no Art more than Rhetorick, eſpecially that part that concerns <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; for he muſt be his maſter in that before he ſhall work kindly upon the will, and move the affections of men.</p>
                     <q>Ille movet dictis animos &amp; pectora mulcet.</q>
                     <p>Beſides, were theſe two Offices ſo neceſſary, the Teacher ſhould never ſtretch himſelf beyond his tether, but ſtint and end when he hath given forth and proved his Doctrine, and then your Paſtour ſhould enter, take his Cue, and begin upon what is taught. But why do I trouble my ſelf in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering this Trivial, ſince among you it is not ſtrictly obſerved? for I dare ſay it, let a Scrutiny be truly taken, and it will be found that not in one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ten of your Combinational Churches a man ſhall meet with theſe two diſtinct Officers, your Teacher and Paſtour. As for us, we diſlike them not; and where conveniently they might be had, and maintenance for them, they were in uſe, witneſſe the Profeſſours of Divinity in our Univerſities, and the Publique Lectures and Readers in our Cathedrals; but to binde eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Parochial Church to this, or elſe it muſt be defective in an integral part, is more than ever you will be able to prove, yea, or any man elſe.</p>
                     <p>Next you inſiſt upon your Ruler. And whoever yet denied that Rulers were neceſſary in the Church, yea, and for that end (though not the ſole) you name. But none will content you, except they be of your own election and ordination, none except the Lay-Elders; this alſo muſt be proved by you. For you know we had, and aſſigned others, and upon better grounds then you will be ever able to diſprove.</p>
                     <p>Your laſt Officers were Deacons and Widows, whom you make to be Receivers of the weekly Contributions, and diſpenſers of it to three uſes. In the Primitive Church ſuch I grant you there were, as is evident out of the Texts you alledge, &amp; that to the laſt uſe they imployed the collected mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: But that any of it was imployed to the two firſt uſes, either for the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115308:120"/>
maintenance of the Table of the Lord, or for the Tables of the Church Elders, I put you to prove again. And for this laſt, I am perſwaded it was not, theſe being likely (if ever there had been any) as now among you, of the richer and abler ſort, and therefore no reaſon their Tables ſhould be furniſhed out of the poor mans box. But if you will take Elders for the true Presbyters of the Church, ſuch who were to labour in the Word and Doctrine, I ſhall eaſily grant you that they had their maintenance (till there was other proviſion made for them) out of theſe Collections and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, though not from the Deacons, but the Biſhops appointment. Theſe Deacons and Widows are not in our Church now, and thereupon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it wants of its integral parts. No ſuch matter, for theſe Officers were but Temporary, taken up according to exigence of thoſe times; for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity being over, the Office was at end. When once Chriſtian Princes, and charitable men, provided by wholſome Laws away of relief for the poor, and aſſigned Officers to that purpoſe, where Hoſpitals, Almſ-houſes, Noſecomia, &amp;c. were erected and endowed to that end, there was no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe of theſe Officers; neither is the Church defective in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegral part, though now it want them, as I before ſhewed out of <hi>Aretius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have then taken a long day for obtaining mercy and ſettlement of peace to the Church; if neither of theſe may be enjoyed, untill it be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and refined in the eſſential and integral parts according to your fancy. For what can ſhe not have her Officers, but of your appointment? no Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, except your Lay-Elders? no Members, but ſuch viſible Converts as you will be pleaſed to admit? Laſtly, be bound to her duty by no Oath, but by your explicite Covenant? upon this you inſiſt, this you labour to prove to the purpoſe, and as if you intended to convince any opponent, you here heap Text upon Text out of Old and New Teſtament, which I ſhall now conſider how far they make to your purpoſe.</p>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The firſt is out of</hi> Jerem. <hi>50.5.</hi> They ſhall ask the way to Zion, with their faces thitherward, ſaying, Come and let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</q>

                        </gap>, a ſpeech borrowed from thoſe who put a man upon a rack, which cauſeth the man to ſpeak what he never meant. And this is the fault of too too many, who ſtrain the Scriptures to a wrong ſenſe. Whereas they ſhould firſt conſult the Scriptures, and make them the ground of their concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they firſt harbour a ſtrong conceit of the concluſion, and then ſeek out Scriptures to confirme it. And this for the moſt part befalls not yours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but all other wanderers from the Truth; they blot their books and margents with variety of quotations out of Gods Word, as if by the inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only of their Copy this way, they purpoſed to affright the unlearned Reader or Hearer into their opinion, who being aſtoniſhed with the fearful noiſe of the Chapter and Verſe, (as the Frogs were upon the fall of the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115308:121"/>
Log into the plaſh of water) might preſently ſtoop into a veneration of what is taught. Here I meet with ſeven places alledged for your explicite Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; but I adjure you, as you will anſwer it at the great day, whether you are fully perſwaded in your ſoul and conſcience, that either the Prophets or Apoſtles had an eye to it when they wrote thoſe words, and what aſſurance you can give us that this muſt be the ſenſe and no other. For if you have not a certainty of faith in this behalf, you do very ill to produce theſe Texts, preſſe them upon tender conſciences, and to maintain a Rent, a Schiſme, a Separation in the Church of Chriſt. That which makes me, and ſhould you, ſuſpect your ſenſe of theſe places, is, that having conſulted with the beſt and wiſeſt Expoſitours I have upon them, I finde not one ſyllable that ſounds to that you intend and collect from thence. What, Maſters, are you the ſole wiſe men? were all men blinde till you aroſe? Beſides, 'tis not long ſince there was an Oath and a Covenant eagerly preſſed, and then the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters ſerved themſelves with theſe Texts; then they ſounded in our ears theſe words of <hi>Jeremy, Come let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant that ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> Then the people were terrifyed with the words of <hi>Ezekiel, I will cauſe you to paſſe under the rod, and will bring you into the bond of the Covenant.</hi> Then the Covenant of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> of <hi>Aſa,</hi> of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in a word; all places that mentioned a Covenant, were preſſed and urged to atteſt the neceſſity of that Oath. What, is now Gods Word become a ſhip-mans hoſe, that it may be worn on either ſide? what, Presbyterians and Combinationals juſtifie their way from the ſame Texts? this cannot be; for if it ſerve one, it will not ſerve the other; if it ſerve to prove a National Covenant as that was, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver prove a Combinational, ſince theſe two are <hi>diſparata,</hi> and admit no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, no more then a National and Combinational Church can be one. One of you 'tis certain juggle with us, and go about to impoſe upon us, and the truth is, you do both ſo, as ſhall appear upon farther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>A cuſtome it was among the Jews, when they had revolted from God to Idols, ſolemnly to renew their firſt Covenant with him, and to take him to be their God, renouncing all other, and to be his people, and obſerve his Laws, which gave occaſion to all the former practices: In <hi>Jeremies</hi> time for their Idolatry; eſpecially the Jews were to be carried into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but the Prophet in this Chapter and the next foretells the ruine of the Babylonians their ſevere Maſters, and their return, which when it came to paſſe, then ſaith he, <hi>they ſhall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, &amp;c.</hi> It then cannot be denyed, but this Text muſt primarily be underſtood of the Jews, and if ever it were literally fulfilled, it was when in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> dayes,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9.38. &amp; 10.28, 29.</note> 
                        <hi>the Princes, Levites, Prieſts made and wrote, and ſealed the Covenant, in which the people engaged wiih them:</hi> and let me tell you, that the Jews in the principal point ever after kept this Covenant, and ſo it may well be called perpetual; for after their return from <hi>Babel,</hi> though they were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into divers Sects to the corruption of ſincere Religion, and were guilty of many other abominations, yet no man can charge them with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115308:121"/>
of ſtrange gods. Of the Jews then theſe words were ſpoken, and in them verifyed, and cannot be applyed to the Chriſtian Church any other way but by the way of accommodation. For ſay I ſhall allow you that the Jewiſh Church was the type of the Chriſtian, then the Chriſtian muſt be the antitype; and what then will you gain by it, except the overthrow of your own cauſe? for the antitype muſt every way reſemble the type, which in this it will not. For this Covenant was voluntary, <hi>Come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſay they let us joyne our ſelves to the Lord in a perpetual Covenant.</hi> You preſſe neceſſity upon mens conſciences; this explicite Covenant is the eſſential form of a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>national Church, ſo that no Covenant, no Member of the Church, to which Chriſt hath promiſed ſalvation. The Covenant in which the Jews engaged, was of the whole Nation, yours is of a ſelected people in a Nation. They, the whole Corporation of them, notwithſtanding this Covenant, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be a National Church, went up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at their ſolemn Feaſts, ſeparated not into private diviſions and ſubdiviſions. You by your Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant are enemies to all National Churches, make it a diſtinctive note, not of true and ſincere worſhippers from Idolatours, but of thoſe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the ſame faith with you from thoſe of your Congregation, that I ſay not, you have as many Covenants as there be factions and fractions among you.</p>
                     <p>That every good Chriſtian daily come up cloſer to his God, by joyning in a perpetual Covenant, and by renewing his vow made in his Baptiſme to renounce, to beleeve, and obey, I exceedingly approve. But that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, except he enter a new Covenant in your Congregation, or that he is bound to do it, or can be no Member of a viſible Church, I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver believe; for mark what will follow upon it. Firſt, there muſt be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution made of all the reformed Churches of Chriſtendome, that there may be way made for this new erection; for the Covenant ſealed to their Members in Baptiſme will not ſerve the turn, till they have a new admiſſion and matriculation by this ſeal and engagement.</p>
                     <p>Then again, conſider what countenance is hereby given to the whole order of Romane Votaries, which to me ſeem very like to ſo many Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>national Churches, in that, every order have their particular ſtatutes, to the obſervation of which they tye all they take into their ſocieties, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Vow and Covenant made, they are admitted. Only that in this they are a little more charitable than you are, that they acknowledge ſuch as are out of their fraternities for good Chriſtians, and Members of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church: But you judge thoſe who are not of one or other of your Combinations, to be Members of no Church. And this is all you have gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by your Text of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> I now come to that of the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 20.37. where we thus read.</p>

But being deſirous to remove every ſcruple, I thought it beſt, fully to open the Apoſtles intent and meaning in this Chapter, which being clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the miſt you brought over it would eaſily vaniſh.</p>
                     <p>Though the Apoſtle inſcribes his Epiſtle to the Romans, yet among them there were many natural Jews diſperſed thither, who could not be diſſwaded eaſily from the Moſaical abſtinences, but continued their obligation to the Law, even after they had received the Chriſtian Faith. There were alſo among theſe ſome who were <hi>Proſelytae portae,</hi> who were bound to obſerve the ſeven Commandments of <hi>Noah,</hi> but being not circumciſed, were not ſtrictly bound to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Chriſtians both theſe were in the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part, acknowledging ſo much as was required by the new Articles of the Creed, &amp;c. yet in the negative part they were not; they held the Judaical Law not to be evacuated, and ſo weak and feeble ſome of theſe were in the faith, that leſt they ſhould offend in eating forbidden fleſh, <hi>ſome would eat no fleſh at all, and came to eat nothing but herbs.</hi> About theſe ſick, theſe weak,<note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> theſe ſcrupulous, theſe tender-hearted and leſſe-inſtructed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the Apoſtle gives theſe directions.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Laſtly, that they be not over contentious, and hot in diſputations with them; for though they erre, yet they were not to be diſquieted, but to be informed and tolerated; <hi>God hath received him:</hi> ver. 3. <hi>who then art thou that judgeſt another mans ſervant?</hi> ver. 4. Imitate good then, and ſhew this weak bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy, aſſume and receive him to friendſhip and communion firſt, then help and cure him from his former defect or diſeaſe, and labour to bring him to perfect growth and health in Chriſtianity. This is the full ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Apoſtle, that charity be ſhewed to a weak brother.</p>
                     <p>Now was this Weakling in the Church before the Apoſtle writ, or was he not? it were againſt reaſon and the purport of the Epiſtle to ſay he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:<note place="margin">Chap. 1.7, 13. Ver. 10.14, 21.</note> the Epiſtle is written to the Saints at <hi>Rome;</hi> in this very Chapter he is ſaid to be in the faith, and five times called a brother. And if he were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to what purpoſe do you urge the reception of him that was received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready? Received then he was to be for inſtruction, for information, for cure, as you do, and may do thoſe who are already in the boſome of your Church; and yet I hope you will not be over-haſty to conclude that then he was firſt received. When a Mr. bids one of his better Scholars take ſuch or ſuch a Boy to you, and inſtruct him perfectly in the meaning of this or that Rule, will you ſay that the child was firſt entred into the School? The caſe is the ſelf-ſame, and therefore you can conclude nothing from this Apoſtolical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115308:123"/>
and much the leſſe if you take to conſideration the following words, <hi>take him not to any doubtful diſputations,</hi> take him then to you; but not by vain diſputes and cavils to raiſe more doubts in his head, but to allay and ſatisfie thoſe which are already raiſed.</p>
                     <p>But well to grant you more than I need, or ever you can prove, that the man was to be admitted, and to be received now into the Church; was there no other way of entrance but your explicite Covenant? this you muſt prove, or elſe this Text will never ſuit to your purpoſe, which will then be done, when any of <hi>Anaxogoras</hi> Scholars will prove the ſnow not to be white.

                     <p>The end of the example of the Macedonians liberality propoſed by the Apoſtle, was to ſtir up the Corinthians to the like beneficence, and it had the hoped effect, as is evident in the former and this Chapter, of which when the Saints of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould have experiment, they would glorifie God; firſt, for the Gentiles profeſſion of the Goſpel, and their ſubjection to it; then for their liberal diſtribution and charitable benevolence which they beſtowed upon their needy brethren.

                     <p>This is well obſerved by you, for there is no reaſon that any man expect a comfort or benefit from any promiſe, or by any priviledge, who doth not as much as lies in him, keep the condition of that Covenant upon which the favour was promiſed. The priviledges we know, and of the promiſes we are not ignorant; but if they belong to none but ſuch who have made and kept their Covenant with God and man, then let them look to it that have kept neither. In the next place, you ſhew us the way how this may be known.</p>

                     <p>That the motion is for your ſelf, I very much reſpect it, becauſe I have ever ſince I knew you, born unto you much affection, as judging that diſlike you bore firſt to this my Mother of <hi>England,</hi> to proceed rather from a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in judgment, than any peeviſhneſſe, malice or frowardneſſe of will, not from any carnal or ſecular end, but from tenderneſſe of heart. But now that you have added <hi>heavenly</hi> to it, it quickens me to embrace it the more; for what friend, what Chriſtian friend, would not lay out himſelf to help his friend forward in his way to heaven? It was <hi>Cains</hi> churliſh anſwer, <hi>what am I my brothers keeper?</hi> this is the voice of a Reprobate, not of one gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the ſpirit of lenity; for ſuch a one knows he ows to his brother <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium &amp; auxilium,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Bernard.</note> and that debt I have here paid. If it may any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to that end I intend it, let God have the honour, whom I have often ſollicited in my prayers to aſſiſt and direct me in it. All the weakneſſe I take to my ſelf, and ſhall be ready to acknowledge and retract it, when diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Some paſſages in it you muſt needs paſſe by, becauſe you begin, and a reviled parent hath made a dumb ſon ſpeak. If the words ſeem many, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many and ſeveral things I had to anſwer. In this length, I have ſtudied brevity, and ſaid as little as I could to every head, and yet not ſo little, but I hope I have cleared up all difficulties. If it work not fully to change your judgment, yet I hope it may have this effect, to make you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a little better of our cauſe then hitherto you, or rather yours have done, and that it is not without reaſon, that we remain what and as we were. Pray let us have your pity, if we may not partake of your mercy, and think of us yet ſo charitably, as <hi>Luther</hi> did of the Anabaptiſts of his t me, <hi>O quam honesta mente hi miſeri errant,</hi> 'tis with a good meaning theſe poor ſouls do miſtake, and therefore made a requeſt unto <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that in his Dominion they might be favourably dealt withall and ſpared; for that their errour exempted, they ſeemed otherwiſe very good men. The infamy that we were wont to be loaded withall, was, that we were worldlings, time-ſervers, pleaſers of men, not of God; but time hath waſhed off theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions, and ſhewed that we have little regarded the world in compariſon of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115308:126"/>
that we are fully perſwaded is truth, and Gods Ordinance. Thoſe indeed among us who were time-ſervers, have ſerved the time, and become ſervants of men; and if you look with an impartial eye upon the men, you have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to boaſt of your purchaſe by them, being for the moſt part ſuch, who ſhould not have been continued among us, but have been ejected by us, could the deſires of honeſt men have prevailed. The better part have been conſtant, choſe rather to loſe all, then not to follow Chriſt. <hi>Nudi nudum.</hi> Some pity then I beg, if it be but for their ſake.</p>
                     <p>You may perhaps except, that in many paſſages I make uſe of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Councels, and Church-Records. Pray remember that you began the way, and cited to my hand <hi>Euſebius, Socrates, Evagrius,</hi> the book of Martyrs. Secondly, remember of what the controverſie is. It is about the Agends, and practice of the Church in all ages, and of that how can any man be certifyed but by Records? he muſt be held an unreaſonable man, who would look to finde that in the Scriptures, no part of which was written in the Apoſtles dayes, and could not therefore relate what was done afterward. If any thing in them can be found contrary to the Scriptures, by their own open Confeſſion they may be rejected. But when they tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they were taught out of the Scriptures, and what they finde generally believed and practiſed through the whole Church, have they not reaſon to take it unkindly to be caſt aſide? If you will examine their veracities by all thoſe circumſtances that are uſually conſidered in taking mens depoſitions, you will finde them ſtrong on their ſide. They were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and right honeſt men, not only believed, but known to be ſuch by all the world. They are acknowledg'd on all hands to be ſo judicious, as would more blemiſh ones judgment, than theirs, to call it in queſtion. What they wrote of, were matters of their own cognizance, art and profeſſion, in which ſure they would have a great care not to be miſtaken. Why then ſhould we brand them, (in whom there was ſo much ability and good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to inform us of truth) with the imputation of falſhood and ignorance, flattering our ſelves, that new and clearer lights ſhine unto us, and that we know better how to regulate Chriſts Church than they? Their private o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions do not intereſt our belief; in ſuch points we are as free as they. But when we finde in them an univerſal concurrence, and a conſtant narration of Apoſtolical conſtitutions delivered to Apoſtolical men, and by them practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſo handed over from age to age, we are deeply obliged to be well perſwaded of it, and to embrace it, before any new invention whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>Had the diſpute been of Articles of Faith, I had forborn this paſſage, (for thoſe are of another conſideration) but when it is meerly of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church, and that which depends upon that Diſcipline, their authorities ſway very much with me, as all credible Authours muſt in matters of Fact, with all wiſe men, without which it is impoſſible for any man to be informed and confirmed in any thing that hath paſſed in the world before he was born. I ſhall deſire you therefore to take this into your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to paſſe too haſty a cenſure upon the fathers, nor upon me for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the teſtimonies of thoſe Fathers.</p>

                        <pb n="240" facs="tcp:115308:127"/>It is now high time for me to beg your pardon, for aſſuming ſo much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to your trouble. To another I would have been more ſparing; but to you I have thus enlarged my ſelf, becauſe I heartily deſire your information, at leaſt, that you may ſee that though I differ from you, yet it is not out of a ſtubborn and perverſe minde, nor ſelf-will, as hath been imputed to me, but upon ſuch ſolid and evident reaſons as it will not be eaſie for you to revel. As I told you at firſt, I am not of a contentious humour, nor love not to tug at one end of the ſaw, if you or any other take a delight to tug at the other; I am ſorry for it. Far more comfort it were for us (ſo ſmall is the joy, I take in thoſe ſtrifes) to labour under the ſame yoke,<note place="margin">Hookers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</note> as men that look for the ſame eternal reward of our labours, to be joyned with you in the bands of indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble love and amity, to live as if our perſons being many, our ſoules were but one, rather than in ſuch diſmembred ſort to ſpend our few and wretched dayes in a tedious proſecution of weariſome contentions, the end whereof, if they have not ſome ſpeedy end, will be heavy even on both ſides. The numerous company of Shakers, and other Sectaries that have ſprung out of your root, and the harveſt the Pope hath made by theſe diviſions, together with the herds of Atheiſts and profane perſons, that as the Locuſts out of the bottomleſſe pit are riſen to over-ſpread the Nation, makes me more than fear what will be the end thereof. The manifeſt godlineſſe we glory in, is to finde out ſomewhat, whereby we may judge others to be ungodly. Each others faults we obſerve as matters of exprobration, and not of grief, and then it is no marvail if the witty Atheiſts ſtand by and laugh, and warme themſelves at our fire.</p>
                     <p>I have here brought my bucket to extinguiſh it, and my earneſt motion is to you to bring another; I know your endeavour may contribute very much to the ceſſation of this flame. Lay it to heart, and ſet it forward what you may, and the God of peace will reward you for it. I have ſomewhere read of an anſwer that Biſhop <hi>Ridly</hi> then in priſon, and condemned to dye, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a friend, being informed that Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> was diſcontented with ſome things in the Liturgy, which is worthy of Record, and worthy to be well weighed: <hi>Alas,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that our brother Knox could not bear with our book of Common-prayer, in matters against which, although I grant a man of wit and learning as he is, may produce popular arguments, yet I ſuppoſe he cannot be able ſoundly by the Word of God to diſprove any part thereof.</hi> The like ſay I about the conſtitution of our Engliſh Church and Diſcipline, though the wits of diſcontented men have been ſharpned to finde out what to ſay againſt it, and their arguments have prevailed too far on weak judgments, yet I know that no man can be able to diſprove any thing thereof from the Word of God; which as to me it ſeems, very far prevailed after that conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court with Dr. <hi>Reinolds,</hi> who after lived a very quiet, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſedentary life, never diſturbed the Church-government in the leaſt, nor diſſwaded any man from the embracing of the Diſcipline of this Church; it may be his reputation would not ſuffer him publickly to recede. And this, let me be bold to tell you ſo, is a great <hi>Remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>a,</hi> that hinders many a learned man to confeſſe his errour, and retract. To which, if that bewitching ſin
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:115308:127"/>
of profit be added, the man is charm'd, as is the Chobber Chobberim, the old Adder, that ſtops his ears at the voice of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely.</p>
                     <p>And yet for all that, I will not deſpair, but will make a trial whether it be poſſible to charm this ſerpent. Every man that undertakes to execute an office, muſt be ſure that his calling is juſtifiable; otherwiſe, though the work he does be good, and his intent honeſt, yet he commits a grievous ſin. There is no office in the Church higher than that of the Miniſter, the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties he is to perform are ſacred, the adminiſtrations holy; he ought then to be fully upon certain grounds confirmed, that he is called to adminiſter, which can never be without he derive his power from thoſe to whom God hath given a Commiſſion. That of the people, as I have proved, is a new, a ſlight, a fallacious foundation, and for ſuch I ſhall alwayes account it, till I ſee it demonſtrated to the contrary. With what comfort then can any man execute his Miniſtry, who till his Commiſſion be aſſured to his conſcience upon Scripture principles, ſinnes very hainouſly in every action that he does, though done with never ſo honeſt a minde. The puniſhment of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for offering ſtrange fire, of <hi>Vzzah</hi> for touching the Ark, of <hi>Vzziah</hi> for invading the Prieſts office, ought to ſink very deep into the heads and hearts of ſuch men. Till they can aſſure me infallibly that the Power of the Keys is in the people, which I am perſwaded they will never do, I ſhall never acknowledge their vocation, and therefore much fear their doom.</p>
                     <p>This I would have ſeriouſly weighed, and God Almighty give the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to it; then I ſhall the ſooner hope that unity will be reſtored to the Church, peace and proſperity to the Nation, Religion will again flouriſh, and the gates of <hi>Zion</hi> ſhall be built; <hi>the Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, and the Calf,</hi>
